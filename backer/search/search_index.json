About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p> <p>That covers a lot! So let\u2019s get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.</p> <p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn\u2019t a dungeon crawler. It\u2019s not about \u201cclearing rooms.\u201d It\u2019s not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like Shadowdark.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It\u2019s not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like Forbidden Lands.</p> <p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like Call of Cthulhu. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn\u2019t a comedy RPG like Paranoia.</p> <p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.</p> <p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That\u2019s its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p> <p>But \u201cheroic fantasy\u201d is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: tactical and cinematic.</p> <p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. \u201cBoth of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?\u201d</p> <p>So let\u2019s talk about what we mean when we use these terms.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#tactical","title":"TACTICAL","text":"<p>Strategy is: \u201cWhat are we trying to do?\u201d Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p> <p>Tactics is about: \u201cHow are we going to do that?\u201d We\u2019re going to \u2026 surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! \u201cNo resurrections!\u201d</p> <p>In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means everyone is looking at the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We can all see that happening, and can talk about what we\u2019re going to do to stop it.</p> <p>That means teamwork matters. That\u2019s why initiative works the way it does\u2014to encourage the players to plan! \u201cOkay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it\u2019ll push him back, and on my turn I can use Phalanx Forward to get us all into melee with the death captain.\u201d</p> <p>We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic! :D</p> <p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don\u2019t feel like you outlasted your opponents because you wore their hit points down before they could reduce yours to 0\u2014you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!</p> <p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, \u201ccombos.\u201d Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and rely on them to do their cool things. It\u2019s a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p> <p>You learn which characters are the \u201csquishies\u201d who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about healing Barlaca. She\u2019s our fury. She\u2019s happier with 3 Stamina.\u201d</p> <p>Our game is not about tactics. It\u2019s not a war game. But it is tactical.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#heroic","title":"HEROIC","text":"<p>Our game is definitely about heroism! :D</p> <p>For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don\u2019t assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don\u2019t assume that. Instead we assume you\u2019re going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that\u2019s part of the fun!</p> <p>You should absolutely be able to run a Chain of Acheron-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that\u2019s not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.</p> <p>So that\u2019s one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen \u201con-screen,\u201d so to speak. This is very closely related to the cinematic keyword.</p> <p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.</p> <p>These things do happen. No one watching Raiders of the Lost Ark thinks that Indy\u2019s gun is magical and doesn\u2019t need bullets\u2014but we just don\u2019t need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don\u2019t need to waste time on it.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#cinematic","title":"CINEMATIC","text":"<p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong visual component. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. \u201cIn All This Confusion\u201d is a good name for the shadow\u2019s ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates a visual that explains how it\u2019s working.</p> <p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn\u2019t feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p> <p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free attacks, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That\u2019s what the name implies. And if we\u2019ve done a good job, when you read the character\u2019s abilities, you think, \u201cYes! This is what I was imagining! I can\u2019t wait to do this!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#fantasy","title":"FANTASY","text":"<p>Just \u2026 you know \u2026 it\u2019s got dragons and stuff. :D</p> <p>It\u2019s worth mentioning\u2014while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we\u2019re developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City In This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.</p> <p>Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that \u201970s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There\u2019s nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!</p> <p>So our setting includes the timescape\u2014our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly \u201cspace fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.</p> <p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style! Although heroes have a few of these options in the core rules, you\u2019ll see more psionics in later products.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy","title":"IF YOU\u2019RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY\u2026","text":"<p>If you\u2019ve most often played medieval fantasy RPGs that use a d20 and have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as primary creature statistics, you\u2019re going to notice a lot of similarities between that style of game and Draw Steel. But as talked about above, our game is explicitly heroic and tactical, and it includes our own ideas of what a fantasy world should include. As such, you\u2019ll definitely notice some differences. We might use similar terminology for rules, but our use of those game terms might mean different things, because we\u2019re trying to support a specific style of play and there are only so many words that make sense to use with a fantasy game in the English language.</p> <p>Here are a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you\u2019ll notice right away. These aren\u2019t the only distinctions, but they\u2019re the most obvious:</p> <ul> <li>Attacks automatically deal damage. You can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not awesome, but at least you\u2019re making progress. The trick is: who\u2019s making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there\u2019s no \u201cI miss, next\u201d in this game, fights tend to be short. 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone\u2019s always doing damage!</li> <li>You don\u2019t need to rest all the time. Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries (the stat that determine how robust you are in combat). But all characters earn the ability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li> <li>Character options are different. We very strongly recommend you start by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can\u2019t just assume the conduit is \u201cbasically a cleric.\u201d In some ways it is! But in other ways it\u2019s very different. You may have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 Fantasy and you\u2019re dying to see how it works in Draw Steel, but you\u2019ll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class sections and being inspired. Once you know how the game works, you\u2019ll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character in here.</li> <li>Smaller bonuses and penalties Draw Steel is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes, but we\u2019ve run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of \u22122 is significant in Draw Steel, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls\u2014the rolls you make to determine success out of combat\u2014if you have a decent characteristic bonus on those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you\u2019ll do even better.</li> <li>Our game has a lot of skills Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don\u2019t expect you to memorize that list. We get into why there are so many skills in the Tests chapter, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in Draw Steel. And skills in Draw Steel aren\u2019t tied to characteristics. If you\u2019re trying to lose someone in a crowd? You can use Presence to Hide! Why not?</li> <li>We won\u2019t be able to point out every difference. Beyond what\u2019s noted here, don\u2019t assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you\u2019ve played. We don\u2019t have the space to point out every exception. So if you\u2019re in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you\u2019ll find that things make better sense. If you\u2019re still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We\u2019ve got tons of awesome community members ready to help!</li> <li>We don\u2019t expect you to do everything to the letter. This is actually one thing Draw Steel does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don\u2019t stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone\u2019s having fun, you\u2019re doing it right.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#the-basics","title":"THE BASICS","text":"<p>The flow of playing Draw Steel is like playing any other tabletop roleplaying game with a Director (also called a Game Master or GM in other games). Play is a conversation between the Director and the heroes that describes the story. The Director sets the scene, describing the important elements of the environment that the heroes would notice.</p> <p>Director: You stand in the doorway of the top level of the ruined necromancer\u2019s tower. The air is stale and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks, beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.</p> <p>After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how their character interacts with the area. The Director then describes how the environment and any creatures in it respond to the heroes\u2019 actions.</p> <p>Alyssa (playing Jorn): I\u2019m going to hang out at the back of the group with my warhammer drawn. I want to be ready in case any of those skeletons we snuck by on the lower levels make their way up the stairs.</p> <p>Matt (playing Linn): Linn uses her Telekinesis ability to sweep up the glass on the floor and form a path free of glass that goes from the door to the dais.</p> <p>James (playing Korvo): I\u2019ll light a torch as I step into the room. Is there anything new we can see now?</p> <p>Director: With the glass cleared away and brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor is covered in faded sigils.</p> <p>At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively interesting. In such cases, the Director calls for some dice to be rolled! Don\u2019t worry\u2014the rules outline when and how to do this.</p> <p>Grace (playing Val): Before anyone steps on them, I want to examine the symbols and figure out what they mean.</p> <p>Director: Okay, well for that, I need you to make an easy Reason test.</p> <p>Grace: I got a 12! What do I know?</p> <p>Director: You can tell these old sigils are part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It\u2019s the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.</p> <p>Alyssa: Uh, let\u2019s make a decision here, folks. We got boneheads incoming!</p> <p>Matt: Linn has had enough of this dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside the room so we can shut and barricade the door.</p> <p>Grace: Uh-oh.</p> <p>Director: Before anyone else can move, Linn\u2019s foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.</p> <p>Matt: Oh, right. Necromancy.</p> <p>Grace: Yeah. Should have warned you.</p> <p>Director: The whole tower starts to sway as the sarcophagus lids slide to the floor and clawed undead hands emerge from within.

It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. \"I dunno, a god did it probably.\"</p> <p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons\u2014all have creator gods\u2014the elder gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.</p> <p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent species petered after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.</p> <p>It may be all species were created by gods. That\u2019s certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won\u2019t ever. There\u2019s still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren\u2019t evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.</p> <p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.</p> <p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.</p> <p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfire. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral prismacore that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually, their science and magics produced the omnivok, machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves, they stopped their work and gave their creation full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p> <p>Normally, it doesn\u2019t work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund\u2019s wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed thirty years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.</p> <p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.</p> <p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent people, it\u2019s for less than virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran\u2019zoi, the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.</p> <p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening. Used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn\u2019t create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angualotls walking around having conversations with each other, wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn\u2019t get moldy in the swamp.</p> <p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! \u201cYou didn\u2019t create angualotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!\u201d</p> <p>This is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter!

Eyes open but unseeing.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026calms me down,\u201d the devil said quietly.</p> <p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch-blackness. The devil\u2019s hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. \u201cUm,\u201d he said to the empty room. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p> <p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.</p> <p>He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.</p> <p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack on the outskirts of a small village, opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d the devil said.</p> <p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Good day to you, madam, I wonder if you could tell me\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAAAHHHHH!!!\u201d she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.</p> <p>\u201cAh. Um. Hmm.\u201d</p> <p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.</p> <p>\u201cHave at you, devil!\u201d he said, assuming something like a dueling pose.</p> <p>\u201cI say! Steady on!\u201d The devil raised his hands.</p> <p>The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.</p> <p>Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I ended up here!\u201d Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. \u201cNow, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLegendarily vain,\u201d his dinner guest teased with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cSimply playing my part, darling.

And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all actors are vain.\u201d She took offense beautifully. \u201cJust the good ones.\u201d She sipped her drink.</p> <p>\u201cWell then, you must be very vain indeed,\u201d the devil said.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, does that answer your question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMostly. Do they speak Caelian in hell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a good question. Unless it\u2019s very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner\u2019s language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I\u2019m sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo cloud of brimstone now?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cStyle counts for something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut wait, that was\u2026.\u201d She did some quick mental math. \u201cFifteen years ago?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn accountant!\u201d</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I did before. I\u2019m moderately good at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body.

As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.</p> <p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.</p> <p>The three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered\u2014then, sensing his human compatriot\u2019s reluctance, turned to look at them. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the lead dwarf growled.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cowards now!\u201d the other dwarf said, a hint of joy in his voice. \u201cLook what a prize we have caught!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d one bandit said, shaking. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the dragon knight, the other bandit added quickly, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know there was one of you here.\u201d</p> <p>The draconian didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf.</p> <p>\u201cThink of the bounty,\u201d the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be rich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d One of the bandits dropped her sword and held her hands up as she backed away from the group toward the exit. \u201cI don\u2019t need it that bad,\u201d she said.

They weren\u2019t afraid anymore.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back,\u201d the lead dwarf said, and the two of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.</p> <p>As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. \u201cShow\u2019s over,\u201d he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman behind the bar said. \u201cThank you for\u2026\u201d</p> <p>She stopped when she saw the draconian was ignoring her.</p> <p>A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. \u201cExcuse me, sir knight,\u201d the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.</p> <p>The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian\u2019s arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.</p> <p>The man bowed his head and touched his forelock.

He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but there ain\u2019t no one else. And there\u2019s this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he\u2019s of Saint Ajax.\u201d</p> <p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away\u2014when someone else spoke.</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to hear \u2019em out, Vaant,\u201d said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p> <p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who\u2019d spoken.

He was middle-aged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons, looked like a captain of the guard. \u201cFolks,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is Vaantikalisax, Knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights.\u201d</p> <p>The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Vaantikalisax asked.</p> <p>\u201cThese people need help. I said I\u2019d find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.\u201d</p> <p>The draconian sniffed, released John\u2019s hand, and looked at the three peasants. \u201cWhy do you people need me? You\u2019re in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust John,\u201d Sir John said, holding a hand up. \u201cThe new baron stripped me of my title.

The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually, the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.</p> <p>\u201cI owe you a lot, John\u2014but not everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not how it starts.

Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p> <p>\u201cThe people need leadership,\u201d John said as he looked at all the folk watching.</p> <p>Vaantikalisax\u2019s reptile eyes flashed in anger. \u201cThey had it. Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax\u2026 I watched him\u2026\u201d The dragon knight\u2019s eyes flinched.

The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>\u201cBlack gods!\u201d Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan\u2019s hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy\u2019s hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\u201cAdmittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\u201d</p> <p>The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\u201cConsort!\u201d An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \u201cWe have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\u201d</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \u201cThey called that one \u2018consort!\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \u201cI am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\u201d They indicated the elf who had spoken. \u201cThis is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know we were here?\u201d Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen\u2019s consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man\u2019s bow.</p> <p>\u201cNothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\u201d the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \u201cAnd approval,\u201d Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\u201cYou come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\u201d Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \u201cMy cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen\u2019s consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\u201d</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \u201cBut have no fear,\u201d they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. \u201cYou are safe \u2026 now.\u201d The pause before \u201cnow\u201d spoke volumes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \u201cI am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\u201d they said. Wenna smiled.</p> <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \u201cFashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\u201d They gestured at the other wode elf\u2019s garb and masculine appearance. \u201cMe? I\u2019m old-fashioned.\u201d They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \u201cGrace never goes out of style.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \u201cTheir gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\u201d Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen\u2019s consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\u201cHow did they do that?\u201d Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\u201cHmm? Do what?\u201d Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\u201cJust \u2026 disappear like that!\u201d</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \u201cDo terran children not play hiding games?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2026\u201d Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \u201cWe do, but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \u201cWell, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that was \u2026\u201d Meliora was frustrated at the elf\u2019s seeming evasion. \u201cThat was magic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say? Well,\u201d Llyander mused, \u201cterrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\u201d The elf\u2019s eyes twinkled at Meliora\u2019s frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \u201cCome!\u201d they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\u201d Llyander said. \u201cWe are old friends.

Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter. They bristled with weapons.</p> <p>\u201cThey seem like \u2026\u201d Meliora said, searching for the words.</p> <p>\u201cLike the lords of all the world,\u201d Wenna said with awe and wonder.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we are their prisoners,\u201d Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not prisoners,\u201d Llyander said quietly. \u201cYou are guests.

It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\u201cShow me an elf who hates humans,\u201d he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \u201cand I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\u201d He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \u201cLove is like sunlight for us, you see.

Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax\u2019s rule.

Wenna and Credan couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cWell, you see, children?\u201d Llyander said. \u201cWe only have more to do, not everything to do.\u201d</p> <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \u201cGather ye, and attend!

And know his word is law!\u201d</p> <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p> <p>\u201cYou have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore\u2019s sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty.

It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\u201d He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p> <p>\u201cHe seems wise,\u201d Credan said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd smart,\u201d Meliora said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised how kind he is,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHe seems a good king.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn\u2019t say anything at first, but eventually, she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember when my cousin\u2019s soldiers hid in the wode?\u201d they said, their voice low. \u201cHow astonished you were?\u201d</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \u201cThis is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how do they do \u2026\u201d Meliora started.</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \u201cIt is not a thing they do.

I think only in fabled Alloy could the Memory of a Sunset at Dawn walk the streets without \u2018scaring the horses,\u2019 as they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlloy?\u201d</p> <p>The Pillar looked at the Arrow out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she said with some glee.</p> <p>\u201cYou were following your vision, you said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my wyrd as the Vanigair call it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she smiled and blushed, \u201cit is not meet to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmm \u2026 you would say maybe. I think \u2026 rude is closer, but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa\u2019er of our tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey it to others.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it like a dream or a nightmare?\u201d The Arrow wasn\u2019t sure how much it was okay to ask.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened.\u201d She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on her legs. \u201cI know not how it is for other doomseekers, but this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of jasper, a \u2026 a mineral we add to our food. I was picking flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm?\u201d The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the moment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p> <p>The Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders rippling. \u201cThat was the end of my vision. At that moment, I knew I had to leave home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax\u2019s war dogs. I think I know this, but \u2026\u201d She shrugged again.</p> <p>\u201cBut how come you\u2019re alone? Where am I? Where\u2019s the Society?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d she smiled. \u201cWhen the vision comes upon you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting, and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the bee? What happened to the bee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on the ground, and you must see,\u201d she held up her pinky, \u201ceven my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee. I sought only to protect it from the ants, but it quickly scrambled onto my finger, and after I stood up, it cleaned itself and flew away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt could fly!\u201d the Arrow said, suddenly full of youthful exuberance. \u201cIt could fly the entire time! It was just waiting \u2026 for someone else to come along.\u201d</p> <p>The Arrow stared, wide-eyed at the Pillar. Even before the young man spoke, the hakaan talent\u2019s eyes widened in realization. \u201cMy vision \u2026\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t over!\u201d the Arrow said, his joy impossible to hide.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#hakaan-benefits","title":"HAKAAN BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a hakaan character, your size is 1L, and you have the following benefits:</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#doomsight","title":"DOOMSIGHT","text":"<p>Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will die.

I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students\u2019 names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p> <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class: What do I think of humans?</p> <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p> <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt\u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p> <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short\u2014almost as soon as you\u2019re born, you\u2019re thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p> <p>That refusal to yield to death\u2026 to death\u2026 is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax\u2019s name is on everyone\u2019s tongue, but I have seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>I was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led\u2026 by humans. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think\u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world\u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice\u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely now, but the future has a way of surprising us.</p> <p>Some of your names, I will see written in future textbooks.</p> <p>But some of your names, I will see written in the stars.</p> <p>(Professor Cilliarwn did not elaborate on this.)</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#human-benefits","title":"HUMAN BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a human character, you have the following benefits:</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#detect-the-supernatural","title":"DETECT THE SUPERNATURAL","text":"<p>As a maneuver, you open your awareness to detect supernatural creatures and phenomena.

We are creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our pride\u2014our religion sometimes, methinks. We have emotions. Joy, sadness, wonder, grief. Love. But they are\u2026 a fashion.

Yeah. Well, that explains what happened when you met Embers.\u201d</p> <p>Count Revile did not like being reminded of that.

I agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.\u201d The polder took the question seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard. First, we need someone they\u2019ll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on that,\u201d John said. \u201cBut it\u2019s \u2026 slower going than I thought.

He turned the glass slowly on the table and now he was mostly talking to himself. \u201cSome people still have to figure that out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is best?\u201d Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.</p> <p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. \u201cWell. If we could be picky, we wouldn\u2019t need a hero,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Well, if you\u2019ve already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: we need a good story\u2014short, punchy. Something that\u2019ll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre \u2026 no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax\u2019s livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going to find three ogres?\u201d John asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Now it was the polder\u2019s turn to be confused.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What do I mean?\u2019\u201d John said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2026 we don\u2019t need real ogres.\u201d Jackson looked at the elf. \u201cIs he for real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d the void mage said.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to make it up?!\u201d John exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \u201cYes, I do mean that.

I don\u2019t like being told what to do. It\u2019s sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever.

And you don\u2019t seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.\u201d</p> <p>The polder grinned. \u201cI ain\u2019t that kind of troubadour. I\u2019m the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPropaganda,\u201d Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn\u2019t notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \u201cHey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.\u201d</p> <p>John turned to see. Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.</p> <p>\u201cI, uh \u2026\u201d Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants.

She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p> <p>\u201cLook how easily this one is goaded!\u201d she said. She spat out dark blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \u201cYou people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these \u2026 bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps from the air,\u201d Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \u201cI could scout the forest around the \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the hawklord and strode toward her. \u201cYou are the elite of Ajax\u2019s winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one,\u201d he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \u201cwill come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\u201d He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p> <p>\u201cThey may pull you apart,\u201d he said to her, and at this, his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\u201cOr I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\u201d</p> <p>At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\u201cShall I let you choose?\u201d the Taxiarch said and drew a dagger from his belt. \u201cI will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026should be ready for anything,\u201d one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\u201d another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight\u2019s shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch bellowed \u201cHold fast!\u201d and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them with the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>John immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax\u2019s cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax\u2019s army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the Taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \u201cAllies of the alien?\u201d He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \u201cEmbers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA kuran\u2019zoi,\u201d the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \u201cA time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They\u2019re intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\u201d</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember\u2019s summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they\u2019d been through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out, all he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn\u2019t an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn\u2019t react. This spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes free,\u201d John commanded, his voice steel, \u201cor you die here.\u201d He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\u201cI see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\u201d the war dog Taxiarch looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. \u201cLittle more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It\u2019ll be nice for you,\u201d his voice lowered almost to a whisper, \u201cto be on the winning side for a change.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember\u2019s eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider\u2019s chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider\u2019s right upper hand shot out, as though she\u2019d been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who\u2019d chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>From the sun\u2019s shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one had seen him move from where he\u2019d been a moment before.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in John\u2019s heart\u2014the Clarion Call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>John hadn\u2019t hesitated, he\u2019d already drawn his sword.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\u201d He charged Lycaon, who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.</p> <p>\u201cDraw steel!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#time-raider-benefits","title":"TIME RAIDER BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a time raider character, you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#foresight","title":"FORESIGHT","text":"<p>Your senses extend past mundane obscuration and the veil of the future alike.

She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert\u2019s extreme temperatures and any sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so that their journey is quickened. The Director decides this is an easy test.

The Director thinks this arduous task has a hard difficulty. Urdoncara gets a 17 on the test thanks to the edge from Adrian\u2019s earlier success. The montage test has 4 successes and 1 failure.</li> <li>Loric, eager to prove himself after his last failure, asks to make a Might test using the Lead skill, representing tying a rope around his waist to drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The Director likes the idea, but doesn\u2019t think the Lead skill applies to the task. He tells Loric that Lift is more appropriate, since the tactician is using their physical skill to aid their friends and not really doing anything interpersonal.

The montage test has 5 successes and 1 failure, but the consequence gives the Director another 2 VP at the start of the next combat encounter.</li> <li>Since the group needs only 1 more success to achieve total success, Karrel says she\u2019d like to assist Adrian in whatever task he decides to take on. Adrian wants to recall lore about the Khem-hor\u2014the inhabitants of the Infinite Desert\u2014to remember their time-honored travel techniques using the History skill. Karrel has the Culture skill, which she can use to assist by providing information about the lives and society of the Khem-hor.

Negotiation covers all these scenarios and more.</p> <p>Think of negotiation as something like learning a new system for combat, exploration, or investigation in an RPG. This set of rules provides a framework for roleplaying. The negotiation rules are meant to be read by players and Directors, so that both understand the rules of negotiation. If a player hasn\u2019t read these rules, the Director and other players who have can explain them to that player during their first negotiation.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#when-to-negotiate","title":"WHEN TO NEGOTIATE","text":"<p>In order for a negotiation to occur, an NPC must have an interest in negotiating with the heroes\u2014but must also have a reason to not simply jump on board with whatever the heroes propose. Negotiations happen only when an NPC has that internal tension between interest and reluctance. For example, if the characters ask a king to send his army into a neighboring kingdom to battle a demon incursion, the king needs to be conflicted. He wants to stop the incursion, but he doesn\u2019t want to risk the lives of his soldiers defending a foreign nation while leaving their own people unprotected. If the heroes want the help of the king\u2019s army, they need to negotiate.</p> <p>Heroes aren\u2019t expected to use the negotiation rules every time one character tries to convince an NPC to see things their way. For instance, if a hero wants information about a cult leader from a captured cultist, a single Presence test using the Lie skill or a Might test using Intimidate is likely all that\u2019s needed. A character who wants to flirt with the local alchemist to obtain a free Healing Potion likely just needs to make a Presence test using the Flirt skill.</p> <p>By contrast, negotiations typically involve all the heroes interacting with one or more important named NPCs who can provide information, items, or services that dramatically change the course of an adventure. Often, this involves the heroes seeking an item of great power, a retainer or companion, the services of an influential organization or nation, or a plot-twist-worthy piece of information. Convincing a lich to lend the party the legendary Codex Mortis, trying to convince a dragon to halt an attack on a wizard\u2019s tower, or talking the leaders of an enemy army into standing down means that a negotiation is in order.</p> <p>To negotiate successfully, the heroes must make persuasive arguments to convince NPCs to do what they want. \u201cDo it or we kill you\u201d is a threat that might well accompany a single Might test using the Intimidate skill, but it\u2019s not a negotiating tactic.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules%20%28original%29/#limits-of-negotiation","title":"LIMITS OF NEGOTIATION","text":"<p>Some players might instinctively feel that the negotiation rules should give them something akin to mind-control superpowers. They\u2019re not used to imagining NPCs complexly, and might attempt to negotiate in situations where negotiation is either completely unreasonable or literally impossible. No matter how persuasive or well spoken a hero is, there\u2019s no argument to be made that might convince the vile Lord Syuul to give up his pursuit of evil and become a gardener. A negotiation typically can\u2019t convince a queen to hand over her crown to the heroes and name them the new rulers of the land, or inspire a dragon to fork over every piece of treasure in their hoard.</p> <p>Negotiations only work when the heroes ask for something from an NPC that the NPC is willing to seriously consider giving them.</p> <p>Negotiation is not a process that changes an NPC\u2019s character. Rather, the heroes are trying to make an NPC understand how behaving differently would be in character. You might well be able to get the hitherto loyal lieutenant of an evil boss to reconsider the error of their ways. That\u2019s a classic dramatic trope. But even then, you\u2019re not changing their character\u2014you\u2019re convincing them that their current evil ways are out of character. \u201cIs this who you are? Is this how you want to be remembered?!\u201d</p> <p>If some players want to use the negotiation system as a means to an end by having their characters say, \u201cJust do what we tell you, or else!,\u201d you can remind them that that\u2019s not how most people, including NPCs, work.

Success.</p> <p>Director: Zola sits back, chuckling. \u201cThere\u2019s two things I can\u2019t stand\u2014anyone telling me to kiss a ring and merry fools who would rather go drinking than fight for their freedom. Luckily, you\u2019re not the latter.\u201d You can tell that revelry also won\u2019t go over well with Zola.</p> <p>The heroes now know both of Zola\u2019s pitfalls: higher authority and revelry.</p> <p>Linn: Linn is going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting more than just the Clock. We have a good chance of recruiting the elves of the wode and the orcs of Forest Rend, and we\u2019re already training the people of Gravesford to put up a fight. If we strike before Saxton can fully build his forces, we all stand a better chance of survival. If you don\u2019t stand with us, Saxton will still come for you. He\u2019s already coming for you. The Clock stands less of a chance alone.\u201d</p> <p>Director: I think that\u2019s a Reason test, since you\u2019re using logic to point out that you have a better chance together than on your own. It\u2019s easy too, since you\u2019re appealing to one of her motivations.</p> <p>Linn: Great! Can I use Lead here, since I\u2019m demonstrating our ability to bring people together?</p> <p>Director: I\u2019ll allow it.</p> <p>Linn: That\u2019s a 14!</p> <p>Because Linn appealed to a motivation, Zola\u2019s interest increases to 2, and her patience remains at 2. The Director gives a \u201cNo, but \u2026\u201d response based on Zola\u2019s interest. At this point, the heroes haven\u2019t promised anything, so she offers them something for free. The Director makes it clear in Zola\u2019s response that the negotiation can still continue if that\u2019s what the players want.</p> <p>Director: Zola nods along as you speak. \u201cYou\u2019re correct, but I\u2019m not sure I can spare the people. I\u2019ll tell you what I can do. I have spies watching Saxton still. I can give you information about his troops\u2019 movements. Will that suffice?\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: I don\u2019t think so, right?</p> <p>James: No. We need an army.</p> <p>Matt: Yeah, let\u2019s push it.</p> <p>Grace: Agreed.</p> <p>Alyssa: I wonder if we can try to figure out another one of her motivations.</p> <p>James: Is there anything I know about Zola\u2019s reputation? I have the Criminal Underworld skill.</p> <p>Director: Make a hard Reason test.</p> <p>James: That\u2019s an 18! Success!</p> <p>Director: Korvo would know that Zola got the name Honeycut because she\u2019s generous with the guild\u2019s earnings. She gives all her fellow thieves a nice cut of every job.</p> <p>Korvo\u2019s success has revealed Zola\u2019s benevolence motivation.</p> <p>James: Brilliant! I think I probably would\u2019ve shared that with the group before this.</p> <p>Director: Yeah, that makes sense.</p> <p>Alyssa: Great. I\u2019ll say, \u201cIt would be worthwhile in other ways for your crew if you joined our side.\u201d</p> <p>Director: Zola\u2019s interest is piqued. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: \u201cEven before his coup, Saxton had a considerable amount of wealth. If he\u2019s deposed, those riches need to go somewhere. The Clock will get a cut\u2014a honey of a cut, you might say. Edmund has also promised to share his family\u2019s fortune with any who stand with him against Saxton \u2026 after the young lord reclaims the throne, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Director: You\u2019re appealing to one of her motivations, so make an easy Presence test.</p> <p>Alyssa: Can I use my Persuade skill too?</p> <p>Director: Absolutely. And you gain an edge because you\u2019re famous to her.</p> <p>Alyssa: I got a 12!</p> <p>Because Jorn appealed to a motivation, Zola\u2019s interest increases to 3, and her patience is reduced to 1. The Director gives a \u201cYes, but \u2026\u201d response while making it clear that the negotiation can still continue.</p> <p>Director: Zola contemplates this for a moment. She nods, \u201cI\u2019m starting to see the benefits. I think I can spare some folks to help you, but you have to help them first. See, my best warriors are locked up in Bedegar Keep. They\u2019re supposed to be hanged in two days. If you free them, I\u2019ll see to it they stand with you against Saxton. We were making a plan to free them ourselves, but could frankly use the help.\u201d</p> <p>Grace: We could push the Clock to do it themselves, but I can\u2019t see Val turning her back on people in need.</p> <p>James: Hear, hear. I\u2019m done pushing my luck on this one.</p> <p>Matt: It\u2019ll mean less time to recruit the other troops, so we\u2019d better work quickly.</p> <p>Alyssa: Then we\u2019re in agreement. I offer a handshake to Zola. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p> <p>The negotiation ends! The heroes could have pushed for a better deal, but they\u2019re satisfied with the offer from Zola, so they accept her terms.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/","title":"Draw Steel Rules","text":"<p>Draw Steel Compendium is an independent product published under the DRAW STEEL Creator License and is not affiliated with MCDM Productions, LLC.

About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p> <p>That covers a lot! So let\u2019s get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.</p> <p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn\u2019t a dungeon crawler. It\u2019s not about \u201cclearing rooms.\u201d It\u2019s not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like Shadowdark.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It\u2019s not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like Forbidden Lands.</p> <p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like Call of Cthulhu. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn\u2019t a comedy RPG like Paranoia.</p> <p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.</p> <p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That\u2019s its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p> <p>But \u201cheroic fantasy\u201d is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: tactical and cinematic.</p> <p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. \u201cBoth of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?\u201d</p> <p>So let\u2019s talk about what we mean when we use these terms.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#tactical","title":"TACTICAL","text":"<p>Strategy is: \u201cWhat are we trying to do?\u201d Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p> <p>Tactics is about: \u201cHow are we going to do that?\u201d We\u2019re going to \u2026 surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! \u201cNo resurrections!\u201d</p> <p>In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means everyone is looking at the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We can all see that happening, and can talk about what we\u2019re going to do to stop it.</p> <p>That means teamwork matters. That\u2019s why initiative works the way it does\u2014to encourage the players to plan! \u201cOkay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it\u2019ll push him back, and on my turn I can use Phalanx Forward to get us all into melee with the death captain.\u201d</p> <p>We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic! :D</p> <p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don\u2019t feel like you outlasted your opponents because you wore their hit points down before they could reduce yours to 0\u2014you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!</p> <p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, \u201ccombos.\u201d Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and rely on them to do their cool things. It\u2019s a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p> <p>You learn which characters are the \u201csquishies\u201d who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about healing Barlaca. She\u2019s our fury. She\u2019s happier with 3 Stamina.\u201d</p> <p>Our game is not about tactics. It\u2019s not a war game. But it is tactical.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#heroic","title":"HEROIC","text":"<p>Our game is definitely about heroism! :D</p> <p>For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don\u2019t assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don\u2019t assume that. Instead we assume you\u2019re going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that\u2019s part of the fun!</p> <p>You should absolutely be able to run a Chain of Acheron-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that\u2019s not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.</p> <p>So that\u2019s one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen \u201con-screen,\u201d so to speak. This is very closely related to the cinematic keyword.</p> <p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.</p> <p>These things do happen. No one watching Raiders of the Lost Ark thinks that Indy\u2019s gun is magical and doesn\u2019t need bullets\u2014but we just don\u2019t need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don\u2019t need to waste time on it.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#cinematic","title":"CINEMATIC","text":"<p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong visual component. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. \u201cIn All This Confusion\u201d is a good name for the shadow\u2019s ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates a visual that explains how it\u2019s working.</p> <p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn\u2019t feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p> <p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free attacks, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That\u2019s what the name implies. And if we\u2019ve done a good job, when you read the character\u2019s abilities, you think, \u201cYes! This is what I was imagining! I can\u2019t wait to do this!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#fantasy","title":"FANTASY","text":"<p>Just \u2026 you know \u2026 it\u2019s got dragons and stuff. :D</p> <p>It\u2019s worth mentioning\u2014while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we\u2019re developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City In This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.</p> <p>Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that \u201970s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There\u2019s nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!</p> <p>So our setting includes the timescape\u2014our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly \u201cspace fantasy.\u201d</p> <p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.</p> <p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style! Although heroes have a few of these options in the core rules, you\u2019ll see more psionics in later products.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy","title":"IF YOU\u2019RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY\u2026","text":"<p>If you\u2019ve most often played medieval fantasy RPGs that use a d20 and have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as primary creature statistics, you\u2019re going to notice a lot of similarities between that style of game and Draw Steel. But as talked about above, our game is explicitly heroic and tactical, and it includes our own ideas of what a fantasy world should include. As such, you\u2019ll definitely notice some differences. We might use similar terminology for rules, but our use of those game terms might mean different things, because we\u2019re trying to support a specific style of play and there are only so many words that make sense to use with a fantasy game in the English language.</p> <p>Here are a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you\u2019ll notice right away. These aren\u2019t the only distinctions, but they\u2019re the most obvious:</p> <ul> <li>Attacks automatically deal damage. You can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not awesome, but at least you\u2019re making progress. The trick is: who\u2019s making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there\u2019s no \u201cI miss, next\u201d in this game, fights tend to be short. 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone\u2019s always doing damage!</li> <li>You don\u2019t need to rest all the time. Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries (the stat that determine how robust you are in combat). But all characters earn the ability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li> <li>Character options are different. We very strongly recommend you start by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can\u2019t just assume the conduit is \u201cbasically a cleric.\u201d In some ways it is! But in other ways it\u2019s very different. You may have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 Fantasy and you\u2019re dying to see how it works in Draw Steel, but you\u2019ll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class sections and being inspired. Once you know how the game works, you\u2019ll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character in here.</li> <li>Smaller bonuses and penalties Draw Steel is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes, but we\u2019ve run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of \u22122 is significant in Draw Steel, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls\u2014the rolls you make to determine success out of combat\u2014if you have a decent characteristic bonus on those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you\u2019ll do even better.</li> <li>Our game has a lot of skills Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don\u2019t expect you to memorize that list. We get into why there are so many skills in the Tests chapter, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in Draw Steel. And skills in Draw Steel aren\u2019t tied to characteristics. If you\u2019re trying to lose someone in a crowd? You can use Presence to Hide! Why not?</li> <li>We won\u2019t be able to point out every difference. Beyond what\u2019s noted here, don\u2019t assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you\u2019ve played. We don\u2019t have the space to point out every exception. So if you\u2019re in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you\u2019ll find that things make better sense. If you\u2019re still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We\u2019ve got tons of awesome community members ready to help!</li> <li>We don\u2019t expect you to do everything to the letter. This is actually one thing Draw Steel does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don\u2019t stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone\u2019s having fun, you\u2019re doing it right.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#the-basics","title":"THE BASICS","text":"<p>The flow of playing Draw Steel is like playing any other tabletop roleplaying game with a Director (also called a Game Master or GM in other games).

The air is stale and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks, beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.</p> <p>After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how their character interacts with the area.

Is there anything new we can see now?</p> <p>Director: With the glass cleared away and brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor is covered in faded sigils.</p> <p>At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively interesting.

What do I know?</p> <p>Director: You can tell these old sigils are part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It\u2019s the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.</p> <p>Alyssa: Uh, let\u2019s make a decision here, folks. We got boneheads incoming!</p> <p>Matt: Linn has had enough of this dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside the room so we can shut and barricade the door.</p> <p>Grace: Uh-oh.</p> <p>Director: Before anyone else can move, Linn\u2019s foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.</p> <p>Matt: Oh, right. Necromancy.</p> <p>Grace: Yeah. Should have warned you.</p> <p>Director: The whole tower starts to sway as the sarcophagus lids slide to the floor and clawed undead hands emerge from within.

Some of those are vast enough to hold entire cities, including Or-Mazaar, the City of the Black Star, from where the Queen of Night rules.</p> <p>The power of the World Below wanes, even as the power of Equinox rises.

A realm of devils proud of their civilization, the Seven Cities are each ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. Living in a world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more interesting down here. The seven dukes of Hell conspired together once, agreeing to create the Order of Desolation, also known as the illriggers. Doing so was meant to extend their power into the timescape, and to defend the Seven Cities from the demon hordes below.</p> <p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience, gaining identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upward out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identities, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.</p> <p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City. A great city of the dead, the site is ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of the desert wasteland of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the grand Heliopolis at the center of Khemhara\u2014and he has a plan \u2026</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#the-timescape-in-your-game","title":"THE TIMESCAPE IN YOUR GAME","text":"<p>We use the timescape and its medieval fantasy land Orden as the default setting presented in these books.

It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. \"I dunno, a god did it probably.\"</p> <p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons\u2014all have creator gods\u2014the elder gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.</p> <p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent species petered after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.</p> <p>It may be all species were created by gods. That\u2019s certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won\u2019t ever. There\u2019s still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren\u2019t evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.</p> <p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.</p> <p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.</p> <p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfire. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral prismacore that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually, their science and magics produced the omnivok, machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves, they stopped their work and gave their creation full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p> <p>Normally, it doesn\u2019t work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund\u2019s wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed thirty years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.</p> <p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.</p> <p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent people, it\u2019s for less than virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran\u2019zoi, the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.</p> <p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening. Used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn\u2019t create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angualotls walking around having conversations with each other, wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn\u2019t get moldy in the swamp.</p> <p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! \u201cYou didn\u2019t create angualotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!\u201d</p> <p>This is only how it works on Orden.

Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter!

No one, it seemed, cared.</p> <p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack on the outskirts of a small village, opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d the devil said.</p> <p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.</p> <p>\u201cOh! Good day to you, madam, I wonder if you could tell me\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAAAHHHHH!!!\u201d she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.</p> <p>\u201cAh. Um. Hmm.\u201d</p> <p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.</p> <p>\u201cHave at you, devil!\u201d he said, assuming something like a dueling pose.</p> <p>\u201cI say! Steady on!\u201d The devil raised his hands.</p> <p>The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.</p> <p>Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how I ended up here!\u201d Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. \u201cNow, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLegendarily vain,\u201d his dinner guest teased with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cSimply playing my part, darling.

And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot all actors are vain.\u201d She took offense beautifully. \u201cJust the good ones.\u201d She sipped her drink.</p> <p>\u201cWell then, you must be very vain indeed,\u201d the devil said.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, does that answer your question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMostly. Do they speak Caelian in hell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a good question. Unless it\u2019s very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner\u2019s language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I\u2019m sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo cloud of brimstone now?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cStyle counts for something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut wait, that was\u2026.\u201d She did some quick mental math. \u201cFifteen years ago?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn accountant!\u201d</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I did before. I\u2019m moderately good at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026 the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here.

As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.</p> <p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.</p> <p>The three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered\u2014then, sensing his human compatriot\u2019s reluctance, turned to look at them. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the lead dwarf growled.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cowards now!\u201d the other dwarf said, a hint of joy in his voice. \u201cLook what a prize we have caught!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d one bandit said, shaking. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Looking at the dragon knight, the other bandit added quickly, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know there was one of you here.\u201d</p> <p>The draconian didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf.</p> <p>\u201cThink of the bounty,\u201d the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be rich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d One of the bandits dropped her sword and held her hands up as she backed away from the group toward the exit. \u201cI don\u2019t need it that bad,\u201d she said.

He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but there ain\u2019t no one else. And there\u2019s this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he\u2019s of Saint Ajax.\u201d</p> <p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away\u2014when someone else spoke.</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to hear \u2019em out, Vaant,\u201d said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p> <p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who\u2019d spoken.

He may be the last of the Storm Knights.\u201d</p> <p>The man held out his hand.

I said I\u2019d find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.\u201d</p> <p>The draconian sniffed, released John\u2019s hand, and looked at the three peasants. \u201cWhy do you people need me? You\u2019re in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust John,\u201d Sir John said, holding a hand up. \u201cThe new baron stripped me of my title.

The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually, the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.</p> <p>\u201cI owe you a lot, John\u2014but not everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not how it starts.

Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p> <p>\u201cThe people need leadership,\u201d John said as he looked at all the folk watching.</p> <p>Vaantikalisax\u2019s reptile eyes flashed in anger. \u201cThey had it. Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax\u2026 I watched him\u2026\u201d The dragon knight\u2019s eyes flinched.

The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>\u201cBlack gods!\u201d Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan\u2019s hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy\u2019s hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\u201cAdmittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\u201d</p> <p>The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\u201cConsort!\u201d An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \u201cWe have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\u201d</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \u201cThey called that one \u2018consort!\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \u201cI am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\u201d They indicated the elf who had spoken. \u201cThis is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know we were here?\u201d Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen\u2019s consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man\u2019s bow.</p> <p>\u201cNothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\u201d the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \u201cAnd approval,\u201d Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\u201cYou come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\u201d Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \u201cMy cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen\u2019s consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\u201d</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \u201cBut have no fear,\u201d they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. \u201cYou are safe \u2026 now.\u201d The pause before \u201cnow\u201d spoke volumes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \u201cI am a song!

My cousin here wears the new trends.\u201d They gestured at the other wode elf\u2019s garb and masculine appearance. \u201cMe? I\u2019m old-fashioned.\u201d They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \u201cGrace never goes out of style.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \u201cTheir gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\u201d Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen\u2019s consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\u201cHow did they do that?\u201d Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\u201cHmm? Do what?\u201d Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\u201cJust \u2026 disappear like that!\u201d</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \u201cDo terran children not play hiding games?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2026\u201d Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \u201cWe do, but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \u201cWell, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that was \u2026\u201d Meliora was frustrated at the elf\u2019s seeming evasion. \u201cThat was magic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say? Well,\u201d Llyander mused, \u201cterrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\u201d The elf\u2019s eyes twinkled at Meliora\u2019s frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \u201cCome!\u201d they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\u201d Llyander said. \u201cWe are old friends.

Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter.

It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\u201cShow me an elf who hates humans,\u201d he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \u201cand I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\u201d He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \u201cLove is like sunlight for us, you see.

Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin.

Wenna noticed. She didn\u2019t say anything at first, but eventually, she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember when my cousin\u2019s soldiers hid in the wode?\u201d they said, their voice low. \u201cHow astonished you were?\u201d</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \u201cThis is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how do they do \u2026\u201d Meliora started.</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \u201cIt is not a thing they do.

I think \u2026 rude is closer, but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa\u2019er of our tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey it to others.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it like a dream or a nightmare?\u201d The Arrow wasn\u2019t sure how much it was okay to ask.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened.\u201d She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on her legs. \u201cI know not how it is for other doomseekers, but this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of jasper, a \u2026 a mineral we add to our food. I was picking flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm?\u201d The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the moment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p> <p>The Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders rippling. \u201cThat was the end of my vision. At that moment, I knew I had to leave home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax\u2019s war dogs. I think I know this, but \u2026\u201d She shrugged again.</p> <p>\u201cBut how come you\u2019re alone? Where am I? Where\u2019s the Society?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d she smiled. \u201cWhen the vision comes upon you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting, and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the bee? What happened to the bee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on the ground, and you must see,\u201d she held up her pinky, \u201ceven my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee. I sought only to protect it from the ants, but it quickly scrambled onto my finger, and after I stood up, it cleaned itself and flew away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt could fly!\u201d the Arrow said, suddenly full of youthful exuberance. \u201cIt could fly the entire time! It was just waiting \u2026 for someone else to come along.\u201d</p> <p>The Arrow stared, wide-eyed at the Pillar. Even before the young man spoke, the hakaan talent\u2019s eyes widened in realization. \u201cMy vision \u2026\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t over!\u201d the Arrow said, his joy impossible to hide.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#hakaan-benefits","title":"HAKAAN BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a hakaan character, your size is 1L, and you have the following benefits:</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#doomsight","title":"DOOMSIGHT","text":"<p>Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will die.

I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students\u2019 names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p> <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class: What do I think of humans?</p> <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p> <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt\u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p> <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short\u2014almost as soon as you\u2019re born, you\u2019re thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p> <p>That refusal to yield to death\u2026 to death\u2026 is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax\u2019s name is on everyone\u2019s tongue, but I have seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>I was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led\u2026 by humans. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think\u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world\u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice\u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows.

Why\u2019s he looking at me like that?\u201d the polder asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. \u201cSorry, I just \u2026 I never met a polder before,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>\u201cNo!

There\u2019s polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s weird. I\u2019m from Tor, I\u2019ve been all over\u2014just never met a polder before.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage. \u201cAm I crazy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy,\u201d Embers smiled. She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other.</p> <p>\u201cJohn\u2019s just never run into one, it seems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re adorable,\u201d the polder said, and drank some ale.</p> <p>\u201cThey must have been around I guess,\u201d John said. \u201cI probably just never noticed.\u201d</p> <p>The polder put his drink down. \u201cOh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it\u2019s funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes.

You make so much goddamn noise.\u201d</p> <p>Jago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.</p> <p>\u201cHumans are loud, yes,\u201d Embers agreed.</p> <p>\u201cDo we have to \u2026 can we talk about something else, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just \u2026\u201d The polder wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYou seriously never \u2026 you never been to an inn? Cavall\u2019s teeth, I can\u2019t count how many inns and taverns I\u2019ve been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we\u2019re good at, I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d John asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p> <p>The little man smiled. \u201cGetting into places we ain\u2019t supposed to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019re talking,\u201d Sir John said. \u201cYou were saying we need the people behind us. I agree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.\u201d The polder took the question seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard. First, we need someone they\u2019ll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working on that,\u201d John said. \u201cBut it\u2019s \u2026 slower going than I thought. I\u2019m betting on a long shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup?\u201d</p> <p>John thought about how to put what he knew into words. \u201cYou know,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cSome people can only be heroes if they think they\u2019re above everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they\u2019re not. And some people \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table and now he was mostly talking to himself. \u201cSome people still have to figure that out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is best?\u201d Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.</p> <p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. \u201cWell. If we could be picky, we wouldn\u2019t need a hero,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Well, if you\u2019ve already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: we need a good story\u2014short, punchy. Something that\u2019ll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre \u2026 no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax\u2019s livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going to find three ogres?\u201d John asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Now it was the polder\u2019s turn to be confused.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What do I mean?\u2019\u201d John said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2026 we don\u2019t need real ogres.\u201d Jackson looked at the elf. \u201cIs he for real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d the void mage said.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to make it up?!\u201d John exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \u201cYes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?\u201d he asked the elf.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll learn,\u201d Embers smiled.</p> <p>The polder turned back to Sir John. \u201cHello. I lie for a living. And I\u2019m really good at it. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>John turned to Embers. \u201cI thought he was a thief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was a thief,\u201d the polder said.</p> <p>\u201cYou were a thief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am\u2014they don\u2019t exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they kick you out, or did you quit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends on who you ask. I don\u2019t like being told what to do. It\u2019s sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m annoying.\u201d</p> <p>The elf smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s a troubadour\u2014one of the best.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John looked at him, nodded. \u201cNo lute, I notice. And you don\u2019t seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.\u201d</p> <p>The polder grinned. \u201cI ain\u2019t that kind of troubadour. I\u2019m the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPropaganda,\u201d Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn\u2019t notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \u201cHey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.\u201d</p> <p>John turned to see. Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.</p> <p>\u201cI, uh \u2026\u201d Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.</p> <p>The knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d the dragon knight said.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#polder-benefits","title":"POLDER BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a polder character, your size is 1S and you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#polder-geist","title":"POLDER GEIST","text":"<p>When you start your turn while no creatures have line of effect to you, or while you are hidden from or have concealment from all creatures with line of effect to you, your speed is increased by 3 until the end of your turn.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#shadowmeld","title":"SHADOWMELD","text":"<p>You gain the following ability:</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#shadowmeld_1","title":"SHADOWMELD","text":"<p>You become an actual shadow.</p> <ul> <li>Keywords: Magic</li> <li>Type: Maneuver</li> <li>Distance: Self</li> <li>Target: Self</li> </ul> <p>Effect: You flatten yourself into a shadow against a wall or floor you are touching, and become hidden from any creature you have cover or concealment from or who isn\u2019t observing you.

Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\u201cOr I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\u201d</p> <p>At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\u201cShall I let you choose?\u201d the Taxiarch said and drew a dagger from his belt. \u201cI will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026should be ready for anything,\u201d one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\u201d another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight\u2019s shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch bellowed \u201cHold fast!\u201d and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them with the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>John immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax\u2019s cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax\u2019s army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d the Taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \u201cAllies of the alien?\u201d He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \u201cEmbers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA kuran\u2019zoi,\u201d the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \u201cA time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They\u2019re intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\u201d</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember\u2019s summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they\u2019d been through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out, all he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn\u2019t an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn\u2019t react. This spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes free,\u201d John commanded, his voice steel, \u201cor you die here.\u201d He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\u201cI see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\u201d the war dog Taxiarch looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. \u201cLittle more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It\u2019ll be nice for you,\u201d his voice lowered almost to a whisper, \u201cto be on the winning side for a change.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember\u2019s eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider\u2019s chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider\u2019s right upper hand shot out, as though she\u2019d been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who\u2019d chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>From the sun\u2019s shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one had seen him move from where he\u2019d been a moment before.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in John\u2019s heart\u2014the Clarion Call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>John hadn\u2019t hesitated, he\u2019d already drawn his sword.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\u201d He charged Lycaon, who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.</p> <p>\u201cDraw steel!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#time-raider-benefits","title":"TIME RAIDER BENEFITS","text":"<p>As a time raider character, you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Draw%20Steel%20Rules/#foresight","title":"FORESIGHT","text":"<p>Your senses extend past mundane obscuration and the veil of the future alike.

A hero trying to sneak by cultists might be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence strikes when a hero attempts to bribe a prison guard, the guard might decide to arrest the hero or lead them into a trap.

First, having skills this specific means that you will frequently make tests that don\u2019t use one of your character\u2019s skills and simply apply a characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it means that having a character who covers the spread of every skill is actually impossible.

She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert\u2019s extreme temperatures and any sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so that their journey is quickened. The Director decides this is an easy test. Urdoncara makes the test and gets a result of 12, earning 1 success for the montage test.</li> <li>Loric, a tactician, wants to make a Reason test using the Climb skill to lead the party over dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The Director allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes one dune easier to climb than another is difficult, setting the difficulty at medium.

The Director likes the idea, but doesn\u2019t think the Lead skill applies to the task. He tells Loric that Lift is more appropriate, since the tactician is using their physical skill to aid their friends and not really doing anything interpersonal.

Adrian wants to recall lore about the Khem-hor\u2014the inhabitants of the Infinite Desert\u2014to remember their time-honored travel techniques using the History skill. Karrel has the Culture skill, which she can use to assist by providing information about the lives and society of the Khem-hor.

Negotiations happen only when an NPC has that internal tension between interest and reluctance. For example, if the characters ask a king to send his army into a neighboring kingdom to battle a demon incursion, the king needs to be conflicted. He wants to stop the incursion, but he doesn\u2019t want to risk the lives of his soldiers defending a foreign nation while leaving their own people unprotected. If the heroes want the help of the king\u2019s army, they need to negotiate.</p> <p>Heroes aren\u2019t expected to use the negotiation rules every time one character tries to convince an NPC to see things their way. For instance, if a hero wants information about a cult leader from a captured cultist, a single Presence test using the Lie skill or a Might test using Intimidate is likely all that\u2019s needed. A character who wants to flirt with the local alchemist to obtain a free Healing Potion likely just needs to make a Presence test using the Flirt skill.</p> <p>By contrast, negotiations typically involve all the heroes interacting with one or more important named NPCs who can provide information, items, or services that dramatically change the course of an adventure. Often, this involves the heroes seeking an item of great power, a retainer or companion, the services of an influential organization or nation, or a plot-twist-worthy piece of information.

In this scenario, Alyssa is playing Jorn the tactician, Grace is playing Val the conduit, James is playing Korvo the shadow, and Matt is playing Linn the talent. All the heroes have a Renown of 2 except for Jorn, who has a Renown of 3 and is therefore famous to Zola.</p> <p>Director: The windows are boarded up, allowing no light to enter the seemingly abandoned Goat\u2019s Eye tavern. The whole place smells of charred wood, evidence of the fire that burned most of the building\u2019s interior three years ago. As the door shuts behind you, light from a hooded lantern on the opposite side of the tavern suddenly fills the room. Amid the blackened walls and pillars, you see that six burly ruffians flank your group on both sides. The human holding the lantern smiles. \u201cWelcome. I\u2019m Zola. Willoughby told me you were coming. Have a seat.\u201d She motions to a few crates arranged in a circle around a wide barrel.</p> <p>James (playing Korvo): I have a seat and say, \u201cKorvo at your service, Ms. Honeycut. And these here are the finest companions a polder could ask for: Linn, Jorn, and Val.\u201d</p> <p>Director: Zola nods to each of you in turn, then says, \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me if I dispense with more pleasantries. These days, no place is safe for the Clock. We keep moving. So tell me, what are you here for?\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa (playing Jorn): \u201cWe\u2019re building an army to take down Saxton once and for all.\u201d</p> <p>Director: Zola gives a mirthless chuckle as she shakes her head. \u201cOh is that all? I have to tell you, I don\u2019t think the four of you stand much of a chance. Unless you\u2019re hiding a legion or two of dwarves in your pockets. Yes, you have Jorn the Mighty with you, but you\u2019ll need more than one famous warrior to win the day.\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: Ah! So she has heard of me at least! Thanks, Renown.</p> <p>Grace (playing Val): \u201cWe don\u2019t. But we do have Lord Edmund\u2014the true heir to the Bedegar throne.\u201d</p> <p>Director: Zola nods, impressed. \u201cI\u2019m glad the boy is safe, but that\u2019s all he is\u2014a boy, not an army.\u201d</p> <p>Matt (playing Linn): \u201cHe\u2019s a boy people will rally around. We have no army, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We\u2019re planning on changing that. Can you spare any soldiers for our cause?\u201d</p> <p>The negotiation officially starts. The heroes have stated what they want from Zola. The Director begins by prompting them to make an argument.</p> <p>Director: Zola leans back on her crate. \u201cThere it is. The Clock has sacrificed much against Saxton. Why should we risk more to help? No one was here to help us months ago when we stood up to tyranny.\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: I nod along as Zola speaks, listening before I say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear of your struggle until after Saxton had already hanged many of your brave people. We\u2019re here now. How can we help?\u201d</p> <p>Before making an argument, Jorn is attempting to learn what Zola\u2019s motivations are by simply asking. The Director decides to reveal one of Zola\u2019s motivations: protection.</p> <p>Director: \u201cIf I were to make a deal with you, and that\u2019s a big \u2018if,\u2019 I\u2019d need assurances that you can end this. Proof would be even better. The protection of my people is my top priority. We can earn freedom from Saxton once we regain our strength.\u201d</p> <p>James: Aha! I got this, folks. I stand atop my crate and say, \u201cWell, we can surely offer that, Ms. Honeycut. We have convinced Lord Edmund to grant amnesty to any who swear to serve him.\u201d I\u2019d like to roll a Presence test to convince her.</p> <p>Director: Hold it there, champ. Zola\u2019s eyes narrow as you speak, and she holds up a hand to cut you off. \u201cI will not swear to serve any ruler, no matter how benevolent. I\u2019ll consider being a partner, but even that outlook is grim if you tell me again that I need to bend the knee.\u201d</p> <p>Korvo inadvertently made an argument using a pitfall by appealing to a higher authority. The Director notes that Zola\u2019s interest drops to 1 and her patience drops to 2. Zola gave a pretty firm \u201cNo\u201d response here, which is what an NPC with an interest of 1 would say. However, the Director phrased Zola\u2019s response in such a way that the heroes know they can keep making arguments if they wish, since her patience hasn\u2019t run out.</p> <p>James: Sorry! I thought that\u2019d work. Seems like higher authority is a pitfall for her.</p> <p>Grace: Let\u2019s try to avoid any others. Val says, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, Zola. We don\u2019t want to do anything else to offend you.\u201d I\u2019d like to make an Intuition test and use my Read Person skill to gauge her reaction to see if I can discern any other pitfalls.</p> <p>Director: Cool. Hard difficulty.</p> <p>Grace: I got a 17! Success.</p> <p>Director: Zola sits back, chuckling. \u201cThere\u2019s two things I can\u2019t stand\u2014anyone telling me to kiss a ring and merry fools who would rather go drinking than fight for their freedom. Luckily, you\u2019re not the latter.\u201d You can tell that revelry also won\u2019t go over well with Zola.</p> <p>The heroes now know both of Zola\u2019s pitfalls: higher authority and revelry.</p> <p>Linn: Linn is going to say, \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting more than just the Clock. We have a good chance of recruiting the elves of the wode and the orcs of Forest Rend, and we\u2019re already training the people of Gravesford to put up a fight. If we strike before Saxton can fully build his forces, we all stand a better chance of survival. If you don\u2019t stand with us, Saxton will still come for you. He\u2019s already coming for you. The Clock stands less of a chance alone.\u201d</p> <p>Director: I think that\u2019s a Reason test, since you\u2019re using logic to point out that you have a better chance together than on your own. It\u2019s easy too, since you\u2019re appealing to one of her motivations.</p> <p>Linn: Great! Can I use Lead here, since I\u2019m demonstrating our ability to bring people together?</p> <p>Director: I\u2019ll allow it.</p> <p>Linn: That\u2019s a 14!</p> <p>Because Linn appealed to a motivation, Zola\u2019s interest increases to 2, and her patience remains at 2. The Director gives a \u201cNo, but \u2026\u201d response based on Zola\u2019s interest. At this point, the heroes haven\u2019t promised anything, so she offers them something for free. The Director makes it clear in Zola\u2019s response that the negotiation can still continue if that\u2019s what the players want.</p> <p>Director: Zola nods along as you speak. \u201cYou\u2019re correct, but I\u2019m not sure I can spare the people. I\u2019ll tell you what I can do. I have spies watching Saxton still. I can give you information about his troops\u2019 movements. Will that suffice?\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: I don\u2019t think so, right?</p> <p>James: No. We need an army.</p> <p>Matt: Yeah, let\u2019s push it.</p> <p>Grace: Agreed.</p> <p>Alyssa: I wonder if we can try to figure out another one of her motivations.</p> <p>James: Is there anything I know about Zola\u2019s reputation? I have the Criminal Underworld skill.</p> <p>Director: Make a hard Reason test.</p> <p>James: That\u2019s an 18! Success!</p> <p>Director: Korvo would know that Zola got the name Honeycut because she\u2019s generous with the guild\u2019s earnings. She gives all her fellow thieves a nice cut of every job.</p> <p>Korvo\u2019s success has revealed Zola\u2019s benevolence motivation.</p> <p>James: Brilliant! I think I probably would\u2019ve shared that with the group before this.</p> <p>Director: Yeah, that makes sense.</p> <p>Alyssa: Great. I\u2019ll say, \u201cIt would be worthwhile in other ways for your crew if you joined our side.\u201d</p> <p>Director: Zola\u2019s interest is piqued. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p> <p>Alyssa: \u201cEven before his coup, Saxton had a considerable amount of wealth. If he\u2019s deposed, those riches need to go somewhere. The Clock will get a cut\u2014a honey of a cut, you might say. Edmund has also promised to share his family\u2019s fortune with any who stand with him against Saxton \u2026 after the young lord reclaims the throne, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Director: You\u2019re appealing to one of her motivations, so make an easy Presence test.</p> <p>Alyssa: Can I use my Persuade skill too?</p> <p>Director: Absolutely. And you gain an edge because you\u2019re famous to her.</p> <p>Alyssa: I got a 12!</p> <p>Because Jorn appealed to a motivation, Zola\u2019s interest increases to 3, and her patience is reduced to 1. The Director gives a \u201cYes, but \u2026\u201d response while making it clear that the negotiation can still continue.</p> <p>Director: Zola contemplates this for a moment. She nods, \u201cI\u2019m starting to see the benefits. I think I can spare some folks to help you, but you have to help them first. See, my best warriors are locked up in Bedegar Keep. They\u2019re supposed to be hanged in two days. If you free them, I\u2019ll see to it they stand with you against Saxton. We were making a plan to free them ourselves, but could frankly use the help.\u201d</p> <p>Grace: We could push the Clock to do it themselves, but I can\u2019t see Val turning her back on people in need.</p> <p>James: Hear, hear. I\u2019m done pushing my luck on this one.</p> <p>Matt: It\u2019ll mean less time to recruit the other troops, so we\u2019d better work quickly.</p> <p>Alyssa: Then we\u2019re in agreement. I offer a handshake to Zola. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p> <p>The negotiation ends! The heroes could have pushed for a better deal, but they\u2019re satisfied with the offer from Zola, so they accept her terms.</p>"},{"location":"Abilities/Common%20Actions/","title":"Common Actions Abilities","text":"Name Kind Cost Ability Type Distance Target Defend Catch Breath Heal Charge Free Strike"},{"location":"Abilities/Common%20Actions/Catch%20Breath/","title":"Catch Breath","text":"<p>By using the Catch Breath action, you spend a Recovery and heal an amount equal to your recovery value.

Not very professional, I can tell you that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo cloud of brimstone now?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cStyle counts for something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut wait, that was\u2026.\u201d She did some quick mental math. \u201cFifteen years ago?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn accountant!\u201d</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \u201cIt's what I did before.

He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap.

The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.</p> <p>The man bowed his head and touched his forelock.

You're in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust John,\u201d Sir John said, holding a hand up. \u201cThe new baron stripped me of my title.

They bristled with weapons.</p> <p>\u201cThey seem like \u2026\u201d Meliora said, searching for the words.</p> <p>\u201cLike the lords of all the world,\u201d Wenna said with awe and wonder.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we are their prisoners,\u201d Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.</p> <p>\u201cYou're not prisoners,\u201d Llyander said quietly. \u201cYou are guests. You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. \u201cWe feel very safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are you kidding?\u201d Dade said. \u201cEveryone knows how much elves hate humans.\u201d</p> <p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\u201cShow me an elf who hates humans,\u201d he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \u201cand I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\u201d He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \u201cLove is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.\u201d</p> <p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.</p> <p>\u201cWell done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it \u2026\u201d He looked at Llyander. \u201c\u2026 by changing my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.</p> <p>\u201cAlas, your escort's efforts are for naught.\u201d Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. \u201cBut this is not nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my mother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. \u201cWell, you see, children?\u201d Llyander said. \u201cWe only have more to do, not everything to do.\u201d</p> <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \u201cGather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew On a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!\u201d</p> <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p> <p>\u201cYou have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.</p> <p>\u201cYou have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my mother labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\u201d He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p> <p>\u201cHe seems wise,\u201d Credan said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd smart,\u201d Meliora said.</p> <p>\u201cI'm surprised how kind he is,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cHe seems a good king.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually, she couldn't resist. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?\u201d they said, their voice low. \u201cHow astonished you were?\u201d</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \u201cThis is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how do they do \u2026\u201d Meliora started.</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \u201cIt is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean they don't even know they're doing it?\u201d Meliora asked.</p> <p>\u201cThen what do they really look like?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander shrugged. \u201cWhat does anyone really look like?\u201d And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.</p> <p>The king turned back to them. \u201cShould any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. \u201cNot bad for your second quest. What shall you do for an encore?\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Elf%2C%20High/#high-elf-benefits","title":"High Elf Benefits","text":"<p>As a high elf character, you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Elf%2C%20High/#high-elf-glamor","title":"High Elf Glamor","text":"<p>A magic glamor makes others perceive you as interesting and engaging, granting you an edge on Presence tests using the Flirt or Persuade skills.

Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if we're going in circles?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we keep going in circles!\u201d Dade said from somewhere up ahead. \u201cUntil we find the elves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe elves have found you!\u201d a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>\u201cBlack gods!\u201d Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\u201cAdmittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\u201d</p> <p>The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\u201cConsort!\u201d An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \u201cWe have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\u201d</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \u201cThey called that one \u2018consort!'\u201d</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \u201cI am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\u201d They indicated the elf who had spoken. \u201cThis is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know we were here?\u201d Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.</p> <p>\u201cNothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\u201d the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \u201cAnd approval,\u201d Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\u201cYou come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\u201d Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \u201cMy cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\u201d</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \u201cBut have no fear,\u201d they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. \u201cYou are safe \u2026 now.\u201d The pause before \u201cnow\u201d spoke volumes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \u201cI am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\u201d they said. Wenna smiled.</p> <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \u201cFashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\u201d They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. \u201cMe? I'm old-fashioned.\u201d They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \u201cGrace never goes out of style.\u201d</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \u201cTheir gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\u201d Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \u201cYou may go.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\u201cHow did they do that?\u201d Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\u201cHmm? Do what?\u201d Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\u201cJust \u2026 disappear like that!\u201d</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \u201cDo terran children not play hiding games?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell \u2026\u201d Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \u201cWe do, but \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \u201cWell, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that was \u2026\u201d Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. \u201cThat was magic!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say? Well,\u201d Llyander mused, \u201cterrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\u201d The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \u201cCome!\u201d they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Wenna asked.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\u201d Llyander said. \u201cWe are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well\u2014likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.\u201d They smiled.</p> <p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.</p> <p>\u201cI will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.\u201d</p> <p>The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.</p> <p>Jeremy turned to Dade. \u201cI feel like we're in a dream,\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYou are!\u201d their escort called out. \u201cThe wode is a dream!

They traded some of their gigantic size and strength for the ability to see the future.</p> <p>But Holkatja betrayed them, and the only future they are allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death.

It immediately sprang to life, the water sizzled and danced as her fingers cooled. She pulled her hand out, shook off the water, and went back to sculpting the granite.</p> <p>The hard, tough stone melded like clay under her fingers. Whatever she was doing, it generated enormous heat in her fingertips, hence the pails of water beside her. The Arrow couldn't tell if this was her talent manifest, or something her people could do, or neither. As he watched, he realized he recognized the bust. It was the girl they rescued during the Society's recent battle with the Academy.</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d the Pillar said as she concentrated on her art. \u201cNot when. More sort of \u2026\u201d She looked away from her sculpture and looked out the window, thinking. \u201cHow. Why. I am told there is a sense of \u2026\u201d she looked at the young man, a teenager, only recently recruited to the Society. \u201cAnticipation. Eagerness when the time is nigh. So,\u201d she took in a deep breath, which was an impressive sight to see in a 9-foot-tall woman, and let it out, smiling at the young man. \u201cNot anytime soon.\u201d Her smile was like a sunrise.</p> <p>Though he had lived with fear most of his young life, mortality was not something that plagued the Arrow's mind. He had a hard time grasping it. \u201cThat must be \u2026 awful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she went back to her work. \u201cNo it's \u2026 I do not know how to say it in Caelian.

She gave more than she stole, I sometimes think.</p> <p>\u201cI do not know how long I have. No one does, but I know my death will have meaning. I know it, do you understand? I know it like I know my own name. Often I feel \u2026\u201d Her great hands clenched and unclenched, as though she were trying to grasp something just out of reach. \u201cI yearn for it. I want it to happen.

We do not seek glory like the folk of Vanigar. But, in battle sometimes, knowing I am getting closer to my wyrd, my destiny, I think I know how they feel. Something comes over me, some enormous sense of \u2026 of rightness.\u201d She smiled again at the young man. \u201cIt scares my friends sometimes, I know.\u201d</p> <p>The Arrow had seen it, and enthusiastically agreed.</p> <p>\u201cYou're not from the Barrow Hills,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Pillar shook her head. \u201cNo, I do not wot of your hills. I am from the hills north of the Blue Cloud Mountains in far Vanigar.\u201d She turned and looked down at the Arrow with some pride. \u201cMy people are descended from the original Haka'an tribe.\u201d She went back to work. \u201cThough I am sure the Barrow Men, as you call them, are a fine people. We're all related, you see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that why you joined the Society?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d the Pillar said. \u201cI had only left home a fortnight previous when Memory came to Vanigar to recruit me. I had a sense my wyrd lay in some distant land, but I did not know the world was so big.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid she look like herself?\u201d the Arrow asked, smiling, enjoying a moment of shared experience with the giant woman.</p> <p>The Pillar chuckled, and the Arrow's chest vibrated with the force of it. \u201cNo, she looked like an ag\u00e9d wise woman of Vanigar. I think only in fabled Alloy could the Memory of a Sunset at Dawn walk the streets without \u2018scaring the horses,' as they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlloy?\u201d</p> <p>The Pillar looked at the Arrow out of the corner of her eye. \u201cYou'll see,\u201d she said with some glee.</p> <p>\u201cYou were following your vision, you said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my wyrd as the Vanigair call it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she smiled and blushed, \u201cit is not meet to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt's bad luck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmm \u2026 you would say maybe. I think \u2026 rude is closer, but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa'er of our tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey it to others.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI think he is right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it like a dream or a nightmare?\u201d The Arrow wasn't sure how much it was okay to ask.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened.\u201d She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on her legs. \u201cI know not how it is for other doomseekers, but this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of jasper, a \u2026 a mineral we add to our food. I was picking flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm?\u201d The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the moment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p> <p>The Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders rippling. \u201cThat was the end of my vision. At that moment, I knew I had to leave home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax's war dogs. I think I know this, but \u2026\u201d She shrugged again.</p> <p>\u201cBut how come you're alone? Where am I? Where's the Society?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d she smiled. \u201cWhen the vision comes upon you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting, and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the bee? What happened to the bee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on the ground, and you must see,\u201d she held up her pinky, \u201ceven my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee.

I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students' names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p> <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class: What do I think of humans?</p> <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p> <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt\u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p> <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short\u2014almost as soon as you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p> <p>That refusal to yield to death\u2026 to death\u2026 is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but I have seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>I was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led\u2026 by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think\u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world\u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice\u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows.

If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. Well, if you've already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: we need a good story\u2014short, punchy. Something that'll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre \u2026 no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going to find three ogres?\u201d John asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Now it was the polder's turn to be confused.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018What do I mean?'\u201d John said.</p> <p>\u201cI'm not \u2026 we don't need real ogres.\u201d Jackson looked at the elf. \u201cIs he for real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d the void mage said.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you're going to make it up?!\u201d John exclaimed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \u201cYes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?\u201d he asked the elf.</p> <p>\u201cHe'll learn,\u201d Embers smiled.</p> <p>The polder turned back to Sir John. \u201cHello. I lie for a living. And I'm really good at it. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn't work.\u201d</p> <p>John turned to Embers. \u201cI thought he was a thief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was a thief,\u201d the polder said.</p> <p>\u201cYou were a thief.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am\u2014they don't exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they kick you out, or did you quit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends on who you ask. I don't like being told what to do. It's sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI'm annoying.\u201d</p> <p>The elf smiled. \u201cHe's a troubadour\u2014one of the best.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John looked at him, nodded. \u201cNo lute, I notice. And you don't seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.\u201d</p> <p>The polder grinned. \u201cI ain't that kind of troubadour. I'm the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPropaganda,\u201d Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \u201cHey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.\u201d</p> <p>John turned to see. Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.</p> <p>\u201cI, uh \u2026\u201d Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.</p> <p>The knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you're right,\u201d the dragon knight said.</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Polder/#polder-benefits","title":"Polder Benefits","text":"<p>As a polder character, your size is 1S and you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Polder/#polder-geist","title":"Polder Geist","text":"<p>When you start your turn while no creatures have line of effect to you, or while you are hidden from or have concealment from all creatures with line of effect to you, your speed is increased by 3 until the end of your turn.</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Polder/#shadowmeld","title":"Shadowmeld","text":"<p>You gain the following ability:</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Polder/#shadowmeld_1","title":"Shadowmeld","text":"<p>You become an actual shadow.</p> Keywords: Magic Type: Maneuver Distance: Self Target: Self <p>Effect: You flatten yourself into a shadow against a wall or floor you are touching, and become hidden from any creature you have cover or concealment from or who isn't observing you.

The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the ruin of a stone church.</p> <p>\u201cIs it that your brain is so small you must talk in order to think?\u201d The woman's smile was a sneer.</p> <p>Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist, and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. \u201cYou are going to die in any event,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Up close she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.</p> <p>\u201cYou seem to be made of bits,\u201d the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. \u201cAnd not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of cast-off scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.\u201d</p> <p>The Taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blonde.</p> <p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. \u201cWhere is your worldship?\u201d he said in a more reasonable voice. \u201cOr came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?\u201d At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise.</p> <p>\u201cYou see?\u201d The Taxiarch said, impressed with himself. \u201cI am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien,\u201d he nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. \u201cI am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. \u201cIf you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.\u201d</p> <p>The alien sighed. \u201c\u2018Blaap blaap blaap,'\u201d she said. \u201cYou should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble,\u201d she nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p> <p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p> <p>\u201cLook how easily this one is goaded!\u201d she said. She spat out dark blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \u201cYou people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these \u2026 bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps from the air,\u201d Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \u201cI could scout the forest around the \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the hawklord and strode toward her. \u201cYou are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one,\u201d he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \u201cwill come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\u201d He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p> <p>\u201cThey may pull you apart,\u201d he said to her, and at this, his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\u201cOr I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\u201d</p> <p>At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\u201cShall I let you choose?\u201d the Taxiarch said and drew a dagger from his belt. \u201cI will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\u201c\u2026should be ready for anything,\u201d one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\u201d another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch bellowed \u201cHold fast!\u201d and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them with the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>John immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\u201cWhat's this?\u201d the Taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \u201cAllies of the alien?\u201d He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \u201cEmbers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA kuran'zoi,\u201d the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \u201cA time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\u201d</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out, all he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn't react. This spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\u201cShe goes free,\u201d John commanded, his voice steel, \u201cor you die here.\u201d He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\u201cI see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\u201d the war dog Taxiarch looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. \u201cLittle more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you,\u201d his voice lowered almost to a whisper, \u201cto be on the winning side for a change.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>From the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one had seen him move from where he'd been a moment before.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in John's heart\u2014the Clarion Call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\u201d He charged Lycaon, who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.</p> <p>\u201cDraw steel!\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Time%20Raider/#time-raider-benefits","title":"Time Raider Benefits","text":"<p>As a time raider character, you have the following benefits.</p>"},{"location":"Ancestries/Time%20Raider/#foresight","title":"Foresight","text":"<p>Your senses extend past mundane obscuration and the veil of the future alike.

In some cases, a desire for vengeance can be satisfied only by the death of another, but an NPC might wish to pay back their own suffering with embarrassment, career failure, or some other less permanent pain.</p> <p>An NPC with the vengeance pitfall believes that revenge solves nothing. They might have gained this belief firsthand, or they might simply not have the ambition to seek revenge\u2014and they take a dim view of others who do.</p> <p>Arguments that appeal to the vengeance motivation contend that the NPC can gain payback for their pain by helping the heroes. Example arguments include the following:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cThe servants of Ajax killed your sister as she scoured the city for his cults. The Black Iron Pact works for the Overlord. Give us her diaries, and we might uncover the pact's hideaway and deal a great blow to your hated foes.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cThat prankster Huckable made your trousers tear at the last council meeting.
