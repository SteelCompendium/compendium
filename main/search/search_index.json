About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p> <p>That covers a lot! So let's get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.</p> <p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn't a dungeon crawler. It's not about \"clearing rooms.\" It's not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like Shadowdark.</p> <p>It's not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It's not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like Forbidden Lands.</p> <p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like Call of Cthulhu. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn't a comedy RPG like Paranoia.</p> <p>Draw Steel is definitely a game about creating amazing stories in which the heroes fight monsters and villains using strategy and tactics. Draw Steel has a lot of other tools! But fighting monsters is sort of non-negotiable. If you're looking for a game featuring extraordinary heroes overcoming dramatic villains without the focus on tactical combat, maybe check out Daggerheart! Just right next door alphabet-wise!</p> <p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.</p> <p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That's its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p> <p>But \"heroic fantasy\" is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: tactical and cinematic.</p> <p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. \"Both of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?\"</p> <p>So let's talk about what we mean when we use these terms.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#tactical","title":"Tactical","text":"<p>Strategy is: \"What are we trying to do?\" Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p> <p>Tactics is about: \"How are we going to do that?\" We're going to \u2026 surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! \"No resurrections!\"</p> <p>In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means all players are focused on the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We're all aware of what's happening, and we can talk about what we're going to do to stop it.</p> <p>That means teamwork matters. That's why the order of combat works the way it does\u2014to encourage the players to plan! \"Okay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it'll push him back, and on my turn, I can use Squad! Forward! to get us all into melee with the death captain.\" We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic!</p> <p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each combat round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don't feel as if you outlasted your opponents because you wore their Stamina down before they could reduce yours to 0\u2014you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!</p> <p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, \"combos.\" Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and to rely on them to do their cool things. It's a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p> <p>You learn which characters are the \"squishies\" who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. \"Don't worry about healing Barlaca. She's our fury. She's happier with 3 Stamina.\" Our game is not about tactics. It's not a wargame. But it is tactical.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#heroic","title":"Heroic","text":"<p>Our game is definitely about heroism! For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don't assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don't assume that. Instead we assume you're going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that's part of the fun!</p> <p>You should absolutely be able to run a Chain of Acheron-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that's not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.</p> <p>So that's one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen \"onscreen,\" so to speak. This is closely related to the cinematic keyword.</p> <p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.</p> <p>These things do happen. No one watching Raiders of the Lost Ark thinks that Indy's gun is magic and doesn't need bullets\u2014but we simply don't need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don't need to waste time on it.</p> <p>Likewise in our game, we don't worry about stuff that heroes in fiction tend not to worry about. We don't worry how much everything you're carrying weighs. If you try to lift a bear, you might have trouble, sure. But nowhere on your character sheet are you tracking the weight of every item.</p> <p>You don't track food such as rations, and you don't worry about how many torches you have. Light might factor into a specific environment, because that can be a fun tactical challenge, but the game doesn't expect that everyone is always worried about running out of light.</p> <p>Basically, we worry only about those things you'd see your characters doing in a movie, or a comic, or a novel about their adventures. Assume all the tedious stuff happens off-screen. Speaking of things happening on-screen \u2026</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#cinematic","title":"Cinematic","text":"<p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like abilities and features to be strongly evocative. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. \"In All This Confusion\" is a good name for the shadow's ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates an awareness that explains how it's working.</p> <p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you experience that action in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn't feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p> <p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free strikes, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That's what the name implies. And if we've done a good job, when you read through your character's abilities, you think, \"Yes! This is what I was imagining! I can't wait to do this!\"</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#fantasy","title":"Fantasy","text":"<p>Just \u2026 you know \u2026 it's got dragons and stuff.</p> <p>It's worth mentioning\u2014while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we're developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City in This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.</p> <p>Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that '70s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There's nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!</p> <p>So our setting includes the timescape\u2014our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly \"space fantasy.\"</p> <p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.</p> <p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style!</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy","title":"If You're Coming From D20 Fantasy","text":"<p>We know that many folks are coming to this game having only experienced d20 fantasy RPGs. This section details a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you'll notice right away. These aren't the only distinctions, but they're the most obvious.</p> <ul> <li>Character options are different. We strongly recommend you start exploring Draw Steel by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can't just assume the conduit is \"basically a cleric.\" In some ways, it is! But in other ways, it's quite different. You might have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 fantasy, and you're dying to see how that might work in Draw Steel. But you'll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Classes sections and getting inspired. Once you know a bit more about how the game works, you'll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character the Draw Steel way.</li> <li>Smaller bonuses and penalties. Draw Steel is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes\u2014tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes\u2014success or failure. But we've run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of \u22122 is significant in Draw Steel, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls\u2014the rolls you make to determine success both in and out of combat\u2014if you have a decent characteristic bonus to add to those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you'll do even better.</li> <li>Abilities automatically deal damage. When you use an ability\u2014one of the unique combat features that defines your character\u2014you can still have a bad turn! A tier 1 outcome with minimal damage and effects is the worst outcome you can obtain with an ability. It's not awesome. But you're still always making progress. The question is: Who's making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there's no, \"I miss, who's next?\" in this game, fights typically last 3 or fewer rounds. A fight that lasts 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone's always doing damage!</li> <li>You don't need to rest all the time. Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries\u2014the stats that determine how robust you are in combat. But all characters earn the capability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li> <li>Our game has a lot of skills. Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don't expect you to memorize that list. We get into why the Tests chapter features so many skills, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in Draw Steel. And skills in the game aren't tied to characteristics. If you're trying to lose someone in a crowd, you can use Presence\u2014the characteristic that represents your character's force of personality\u2014to try to hide! Why not?</li> <li>We won't be able to point out every difference. Beyond what's noted here, don't assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you've played. We don't have the space to point out every exception. So if you're in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you'll find that things make better sense. If you're still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We've got tons of awesome community members ready to help!</li> <li>We don't expect you to do everything to the letter. This is actually one thing Draw Steel does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don't stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#glossary-index","title":"GLOSSARY INDEX","text":"<p>The following rules and game terms are fully defined and expanded upon in this book.

A double bane applies no penalty to a power roll, but instead automatically decreases the tier outcome of the roll by one tier.</p> <p>Double Edge: When a creature has two or more edges and no banes applied to a power roll l, they have a double edge on the roll. A double edge adds no bonus to a power roll, but instead automatically increases the tier outcome of the roll by one tier.</p> <p>Downtime Project: A task a hero undertakes during one or more respites.</p> <p>Dragon Knight: An ancestry with a draconic heritage.</p> <p>Drama: The troubadour's Heroic Resource.</p> <p>Dwarf: An ancestry with stone skin and short stature.</p> <p>Dying: A state a hero enters when their Stamina is 0 or lower but doesn't reach the negative of their winded value.

A falling creature can reduce the effective height of their fall by a number of squares equal to their Agility score (minimum 0).</p> <p>Ferocity: The fury's Heroic Resource.</p> <p>Flanking: When two or more allied creatures are adjacent to and on opposite sides of an enemy, those creatures are flanking that enemy.

If a flying creature is made prone or has their speed reduced to 0, they fall.</p> <p>Focus: The tactician's Heroic Resource.</p> <p>Forced Movement: When an ability or effect compels a creature to move, usually against their will. There are three types of forced movement: a pull, a push, and a slide. Forced movement is always along the ground unless noted as vertical. Forced movement can be reduced by stability.</p> <p>Follower: An NPC dedicated to helping a hero. Many of the actions of a follower are controlled by a player.</p> <p>Free Maneuver: A maneuver that doesn't count against the one maneuver per turn a creature can take. A free maneuver can only be used by a creature on their turn.</p> <p>Free Strike: The simplest and most basic weapon attack any creature can make. A free strike is most often used on another creature's turn, when a rule gives a creature not taking their turn an opportunity to make a quick hit against a foe.

Play is a conversation between the Director and the heroes that describes the story. The Director sets the scene, describing the important elements of the environment that the heroes would notice.</p> <p>Director (Willy): You stand in the doorway of the top level of the ruined necromancer's tower. The air is stale and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks, beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.</p> <p>After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how their character interacts with the area. The Director then describes how the environment and any creatures in it respond to the heroes' actions.</p> <p>Alyssa (playing Jorn, a tactician): I'm going to hang out at the back of the group with my warhammer drawn. I want to be ready in case any of those skeletons we snuck by on the lower levels make their way up the stairs.</p> <p>Matt (playing Linn, a talent): Linn uses her Minor Telekinesis ability to sweep up the glass on the floor and form a path free of glass that goes from the door to the dais.</p> <p>James (playing Korvo, a shadow): I'll light a torch as I step into the room. Is there anything new we can see now?</p> <p>Director: With the glass cleared away and brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor is covered in faded sigils.</p> <p>At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively interesting. In such cases, the Director calls for some dice to be rolled! Don't worry\u2014the rules outline when and how to do this.</p> <p>Grace (playing Val, a conduit): Before anyone steps on them, I want to examine the symbols and figure out what they mean.</p> <p>Director: Okay, well for that, I need you to make an easy Reason test.</p> <p>Grace: I got a 12! What do I know?</p> <p>Director: You can tell these old sigils are part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It's the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.</p> <p>Alyssa: Uh, let's make a decision here, folks. We got boneheads incoming!</p> <p>Matt: Linn has had enough of this dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside the room so we can shut and barricade the door.</p> <p>Grace: Uh-oh.</p> <p>Director: Before anyone else can move, Linn's foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.</p> <p>Matt: Oh, right. Necromancy.</p> <p>Grace: Yeah. Should have warned you.</p> <p>Director: The whole tower starts to sway as the sarcophagus lids crash to the floor and clawed undead hands emerge from within. Six decaying devils, each tattooed with glowing green runes, rise. They're eager for violence.</p> <p>James: I think we found the Rotting Lords of Hell.</p> <p>Director: Draw steel!</p> <p>When combat starts, it's time to use a square-gridded map and miniatures to represent the position of the heroes relative to their enemies and the environment.

While the greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the colleges in the university, which has historically doubled as the prince's intelligence agency.</p> <p>House Vorona run the city's navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy's cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona's Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing Capital has to a city-wide law enforcement organization. Each great house is expected to police its own district.</p> <p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring that gives Vorona access to intelligence other factions can only dream of.</p> <p>House Navarr, oldest of the great houses, enforces the church's law, which they call justice. Led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of the most powerful church in the city\u2014the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless\u2014House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and orders of knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.</p> <p>Arguably the most powerful great house, House Valetta controls the Arbitros Fiat, the tax collectors. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore who, in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, opened the Codex Mortis and spoke the ritual which should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed every mortal in her district, including herself, into deathless revenants. Now, the Duchess Lenore is an immortal vampire queen. A dead lady, ruling over a dead city.</p> <p>After the Lilac Night, when the prince was no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes they collected, Lady Shirome</p> <p>coordinated with two other guilds to buy Great House status for themselves.</p> <p>Lady Shirome runs the city's assayers guild, the Fulcrum. The guild controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was the Fulcrum that convinced the prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p> <p>The Broadsheets, formally known as the Font, publish the thrice-daily news sheets everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster In\u0101n al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in the city.</p> <p>The Farrier's Guild, popularly known as the Rasp, control transport throughout the city. Led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from Alloy who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the 13-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He created the Kites, couriers famous for getting a message anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. Kashimir's monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives him enormous power, and he is not shy about seeking more.</p> <p>Three years ago, the prince of Capital died leaving no heir or even a likely candidate. He was a young man, only forty-one, but the events surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and inaccurate accounts. Was he murdered like a commoner, or assassinated by a political rival? Evidence is scant, rumor substitutes as fact.</p> <p>Now the great game takes on a new meaning as the four great houses and three newly ascendant guilds jockey for position, each wanting to step into the power vacuum left by the dead prince. Everyone knows a war is coming, a war of succession that means fighting on the street. But each player in the game would much prefer it if someone else made the first move.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#the-myriad-worlds-of-the-timescape","title":"The Myriad Worlds of the Timescape","text":"<p>Orden is only one world in the timescape! Each star in the night sky is another, though this fact is not known to most people living on Orden. Old fashioned people still use the archaic term \"plane\" to describe these worlds, while sages use geometric formulae, describing these worlds they call \"manifolds,\" but they all mean the same thing.</p> <p>Higher worlds are more energetic, affording access to alien technologies. Great starfreighters ply the space-lanes, and knights wield psionically powered hard-light blades dueling against star pirates with hard-light blasters.</p> <p>The lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such extraordinary technology to function, and so rely on magic to break the rules.</p> <p>On Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL, the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade across the upper worlds, defending the starfreighters from the time raiders and the infamous pirate band the Starslayers on their legendary ship the K.R.A.D.1 Fearless.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the formless proteans rebelled against the synliroi who once ruled the Plane of Uttermost Chaos, exiling the voiceless talkers to the World Below. Now masters of their world, the proteans take to the stars in their living changeships, hurling their small fleet against the tyrannical unquestioned might of UNISOL.</p> <p>On Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds, proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire dwarves, even humans in Quintessence's capital city of Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the gateway to the timescape. People travelling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible law of UNISOL.</p> <p>Traveling downward from Quintessence one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. Technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind or the miracle mineral iridoss, also known as prismacore.</p> <p>Almost coterminal with Orden is its sister-manifold, the World Below, the Dark Under All, a plane of exiles ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star's Silver, the Queen of Night, first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves, and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, only endless caverns and warrens, some vast enough to hold entire cities, like Or-Mazaar City of the Black Star from which the Queen of Night rules.</p> <p>The power of the World Below wanes, while the power of Equinox waxes. A smaller, parasitic manifold home to the twilight celestials and their servants the shadow elves, Equinox is ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below who plots to bridge the sea between worlds and colonize Orden making a new home for her people before their old world dies. A fierce, fairy-tale, weird magic, jungle world of permanent twilight also known as Dusk.</p> <p>The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell is among the lowest of the lower planes. A land of devils proud of their civilization, each of the seven cities is ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. A world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more interesting down here.</p> <p>The seven archdevils conspired together once; agreeing to create the Order of Desolation\u2014also known as the Illriggers\u2014to extend their power into the timescape, and defend Hell from the horde of demons below.</p> <p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience and gain identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upwards, out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identity, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.</p> <p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City, a city of the dead, ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the Heliopolis.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#setting-design","title":"Setting Design","text":"<p>Orden and the timescape were both designed over the last 25 years to be an explicitly commercial setting. A product where you could find all the things everyone expects to find in a classic fantasy setting, with new takes on classic tropes and a little more \"Why are things like this?\" work done to ground everything and make things feel plausible. None of this makes Orden \"better\" than other settings, it just gives it character.</p> <p>Orden is not explicitly a high fantasy world, even though there are some pretty high fantasy things going on in it, because the average person has very little access to magic. The typical village might have a priest who knows some real prayers that close wounds or cure minor ailments, or an alchemist or hedge wizard who can brew some potions or conjure minor spells, but that's the extent of it. The result is, though Orden is a pre-industrial world with technology and societies akin to 13th-century Europe, the quality of life of the people who live there is a lot closer to ours. They live about as long as we do, die from disease about as often as we do, and generally have diets similar to ours, though with vastly more basic and constricted options on their menus.</p> <p>In Capital, for instance, people use flying tapestries to get around the city quickly, but these are a luxury available only to the rich. The vast majority of Capital's citizens live a life basically the same as your average Londoner in Shakespeare's time. Less plague and fire, though.</p> <p>It's not clear to us, looking in, but it doesn't seem as though Orden operates according to the real-world laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. People in the middle ages here on Earth didn't know about quarks or DNA, but they still knew everything was made of \"stuff\" and everyone expected a child to more or less resemble their parents. Essentially, Orden works the way people living in any culture's medieval era believed the real world actually worked. Because of the presence of magic, prayer, and psionics in the world, it's unlikely anything like science or an industrial age will ever come to Orden.</p> <p>Ultimately, while there are 10th-level characters out there, these are exceedingly rare. Most people in Orden do not have class levels. Only a few are 1st level anything! No one has ever tried to take a census of all the censors, conduits, furies, and so forth, but if they did, they'd probably end up with a chart that looks a lot like Zipf's Law.</p> <p>Finally, most information about Orden and the timescape is presented from the point of view of someone living in Orden. They can tell you what they think they know, but even learned historians do not agree, and new information constantly comes to light challenging the accepted academic wisdom. Just like \u2026 you get it.</p> <p>This lack of objective certainty not only makes it more fun for us to work on Orden, it makes it easier for you to make Orden yours. This comes at the price of certainty. (Are the Dragon Phalanx really \"incorruptible?\" Well, a lot of people still say that! In spite of concrete evidence to the contrary!) But we think it helps relieve some of the anxiety Directors have when they want to run a game in Orden but are afraid they don't know \"enough\" or \"everything.\" Not to worry. No one knows everything!</p> <p>P.S. We use the phrase \"Orden and the timescape\" because Orden is, as it were, the star of the show. But Orden is very clearly only one world in the timescape. It's like those astronomy maps hanging on the wall in your grade school science class that said, \"Earth and the solar system.\" Like that map, any map of the timescape will be an artist's interpretation, not drawn to scale, and never wholly accurate depending on what information you're looking for.</p> <p>The Timescape in Your Game</p> <p>We use the timescape and its medieval fantasyland Orden as the default setting presented in these books. Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy world. We also think it's easier for you to take the names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them with your own. We might reference some hero or villain, saint or god, whose name makes you think, \"Well, I don't have that in my setting.\" If we do a good job, though, you might be inspired to say, \"But that makes me think \u2026\" And being inspired is part of the fun!</p> <p>If you're the Director, you can use as many or as few of the details of the timescape as you like. You might wish to create your own world within the timescape, or use a setting you've created that exists outside of the official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from settings published by other companies. There are no rules when it comes to worldbuilding. Feel free to take what you like from this book and change the rest. For example, you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone skin. That's fine. You can make them fleshy, stout, bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers, or anything else you wish. As long as you're running a heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the game's rules are still likely to serve your narrative even if that narrative deviates from ours.</p> <p>If you're a player, ask your Director about the setting where the game takes place and discuss with them the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest discussion with your Director can lead to everyone getting what they want out of the game.</p> <p>What's Next?

Among them are devils, dwarves, elves, time raiders\u2014and of course humans, whose culture and history dominates many worlds.</p> <p>Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn't grant you cultural benefits, such as crafting or lore skills, though. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.</p> <p>In Draw Steel, ancestry describes how you were born. Culture (part of Chapter 4: Background) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!</p> <p>This chapter details twelve ancestries for the game:</p> <p>Devil: Devils originated in the Seven Cities of Hell and have a supernatural charisma that helps them persuade others. They are similar in stature to humans, and their skin tones include deep blues, purples, and reds. They sport horns, eyes of all shades (including gold and red), and tails, and some have feathered or leathery wings.</p> <p>Dragon Knight: Dragon knights are muscled draconic humanoids who stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. The scales covering their reptilian heads, bodies, and tails can be almost any color. All dragon knights have wings, but on only a few are those wings big enough to let them fly.</p> <p>Dwarf: Humanoids with stony skin, dwarves have short and stout bodies. Many carve supernatural runes into their flesh, and some have beards made of crystals.</p> <p>Wode Elf: Lithe humanoids with finely furred skin in all shades of blue, wode elves have angular features and large, pointed ears akin to a bat's. They possess a supernatural glamor that allows them to blend in with their surroundings when they wish to hide.</p> <p>High Elf: Stately and graceful, high elves have tall, willowy bodies, pointed ears, and smoother skin than most other humanoids. Rare metal inlays such as gold, platinum, palladium, and iridium act as organic components within their skin. The truest form of any high elf is hidden from most\u2014sometimes even from themself\u2014thanks to a supernatural glamor that makes them more attractive to others, whatever that might mean to an individual. This glamor transcends physical appearance, also slightly altering a high elf's tone and smell.</p> <p>Hakaan: Descended from stone giants, the mighty hakaan stand over 9 feet tall and have well-muscled bodies made of organic stone. They are the largest ancestry in this book!</p> <p>Human: Humans are the most numerous people in Orden and many other fantasy worlds! In Draw Steel, humans have all the diversity that our species displays in real life\u2014and they can sense the presence of supernatural energy!</p> <p>Memonek: Originating on Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek are a machine people made of metal, marble, glass, and other inorganic materials. Their bodies are lightweight, making them easier to move and letting them fall at slower speeds.</p> <p>Orc: Orcs have skin in green tones and stand slightly taller and wider than humans. A supernatural energy they call \"the blood fire\" flows through their veins, igniting colorful lines in an orc's skin during life-ordeath battles.</p> <p>Polder: The smallest of the ancestries in this book, polders stand no taller than 3-1/2 feet. They look like smaller humans, and they have the ability to blend in with the shadows.</p> <p>Revenant: No hero starts their life as a revenant. Rather, these undead creatures return to the world of the living because they have dire business that must be finished. A character of any ancestry can become a revenant.</p> <p>Time Raider: Travelers of the timescape, the time raiders (or kuran'zoi as they call themselves) have four arms and a single ocular sensor instead of a pair of eyes. Many have innate psionic abilities that make them capable warriors.</p> <p>Other Sections</p> <p>The rules for using ancestries refer to lots of other parts of the game. You can find information on specific topics as follows:</p> <p>Edges and banes, Recoveries, respites: Chapter 1: The Basics</p> <p>Languages: Chapter 4: Background</p> <p>Abilities, conditions, potencies, saving throws, surges: Chapter 5: Classes</p> <p>Skills, tests: Chapter 9: Tests</p> <p>Crafting projects: Chapter 12: Downtime Projects</p> <p>Main actions and maneuvers, creature size, damage and Stamina, dying and death, flanking, movement and forced movement, winded: Chapter 10: Combat</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#on-the-origin-of-species","title":"On the Origin of Species","text":"<p>Orden (talked about in Chapter 1: The Basics) is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. \"I dunno, a god did it probably.\"</p> <p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons, all have creator gods\u2014the Elder Gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.</p> <p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent, species petered out after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.</p> <p>It may be all species were created by gods. That's certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won't ever. There's still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren't evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.</p> <p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.</p> <p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.</p> <p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfired. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral iridoss, known as prismacore, that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually their science and magics produced the omnivok\u2014machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves they stopped their work and gave their creations full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p> <p>Normally, it doesn't work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed 30 years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.</p> <p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.</p> <p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent species, it's for less-than-virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran'zoi\u2014the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and who carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.</p> <p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening, used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn't create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angulotls walking around having conversations with each other,</p> <p>wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn't get moldy in the swamp.</p> <p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! \"You didn't create angulotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!\"</p> <p>This is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.</p> <p>At the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and replace it with something you made up, it will be better. Because it's yours!</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#names-by-ancestry","title":"Names by Ancestry","text":"<p>Obviously you're free to invent whatever name you want for your character!

They do not have and do not use last names or family names. Everyone in the village knows who you mean when you refer to \"William.\" Even if there's more than one William in the village, you can usually tell who someone's referring to from context. Sometimes folks prepend \"our\" to someone's name meaning: the one related to or otherwise concerned with me and my family. \"Our William\" for instance.</p> <p>If that's not enough, folks use another identifier known as a byname. If there were two boys in the village named Much, one of them might be called Much the Miller's Son, to distinguish them from the other lad.</p> <p>If you leave your village regularly, say to trade with others in a distant market, then your byname might be the place you're from. Alan from the village in the dale, might become known as Alan from the Dale, or even Alan-a-Dale. But everyone back home just calls you Alan.</p> <p>A byname might refer to your profession. Clyde the Cartwright is a perfectly normal byname. But no one you met would assume \"Cartwright\" was your 'family name.' People who live permanently in a very large city like Capital use family names, because almost no first name is sufficiently unique to identify you, and \"Marissa the Cartwright's Daughter\" quickly evolves into Marissa Cartwright.</p> <p>Most nobles in Orden also use the name of the area they rule as part of their name. When someone refers to Lord Edmund Bedegar everyone listening silently, without thinking about it, adds \"of\" between the name and the place. Edmund is both Edmund, and the Lord of Bedegar, and Edmund, Lord of Bedegar, and therefore sometimes Lord Edmund Bedegar. Even though \"Bedegar\" looks like a \"last name\" to us, and is being used in that manner sometimes, it's not exactly his last name. It's still just another kind of byname.</p> <p>Unlike remote villages, well settled areas where many towns and villages are all networked by roads often do use surnames to help differentiate one William from the other twenty within a densely populated area.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#names-and-gender","title":"Names and Gender","text":"<p>Most cultures in Vasloria make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, though not all do.

Here in the real world, you can't tell a person's gender just from the name \"Shane.\" This is mostly because which names are considered masculine or feminine changes over time, and when this happens, there's a period\u2014maybe a few generations\u2014where the name could refer to a person of any gender.</p> <p>Of course, there's no law (neither metaphorically nor literally) that requires your character to go by their birth name. They might not even know their birth name depending on what happened after they were born. It's not unusual, especially among talents, for a hero to adopt a moniker or sobriquet instead of a name. And in some cultures, there's a tradition of changing your name\u2014or at least how you prefer to be known\u2014as you go through different stages of life. High elves sometimes adopt a wholly new name when they reach a certain age, or more commonly, they choose a different component of their name.

Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a diagram, look at the chalk markings he'd made on the floor, tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an esoteric symbol.</p> <p>One of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the small room noticeably darker. \"Damn and blast!\" he hissed. Then he relit it from another candle.</p> <p>Stepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He'd spent his last coppers on the candles\u2014they weren't cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said a skull\u2014it didn't even specify a human skull! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual know if the skull was real?</p> <p>He was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help. He opened the book and turned the page\u2014then began to speak the ritual.</p> <p>Moments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared \u2026 there was a devil standing in his basement\u2014dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.</p> <p>\"Aha! Yes, finally.\" The creature rubbed his hands together. \"It's about time,\" he said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. \"Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes.\" He cleared his throat. \"On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you \u2026\" But his speech fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>\"It worked!\" Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. \"Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after years! I will have my revenge! Hahaha \u2026! *cough* *cough*\" Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing.</p> <p>\"Dismiss me from service, will they?! *cough* Old and useless \u2026 am I?! I'll show them!\" He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. \"I will hex them and torture them until they \u2026\"</p> <p>He stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. \"Until they \u2026 until \u2026\" He clutched his chest.</p> <p>\"Uh-oh,\" the devil said, genuinely worried.</p> <p>\"HNNG!\" Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.</p> <p>\"Nono. Nurse!\" the devil called out. \"Doctor?! Is anyone \u2026 you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some \u2026 some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always \u2026\"</p> <p>Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.</p> <p>\"\u2026 calms me down,\" the devil said quietly.</p> <p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch blackness. The devil's hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. \"Um,\" he said to the empty room. \"Uh-oh.\"</p> <p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.</p> <p>He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.</p> <p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack, on the outskirts of a small village opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.</p> <p>\"Ah,\" the devil said.</p> <p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.</p> <p>\"Oh! Good day to you, madam. I wonder if you could tell me \u2026\"</p> <p>\"AAAHHHHH!!!\" she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.</p> <p>\"Ah. Um. Hmm.\"</p> <p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.</p> <p>\"Have at you, devil!\" he said, assuming something like a dueling pose. \"I say!

Do they speak Caelian in Hell?\"</p> <p>\"What a good question. Unless it's very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I'm sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.\"</p> <p>\"No cloud of brimstone now?\" she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \"Style counts for something.\"</p> <p>\"But wait, that was \u2026\" She did some quick mental math. \"Fifteen years ago?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\" \"An accountant!\"</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \"It's what I did before. I'm moderately good at it.\" \"And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?\"</p> <p>\"Well \u2026\" Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. \"It's just that \u2026 the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here.

The dwarf appeared to notice her for the first time, peered at her, took in her raiment, and went back to work. \"Nine against Saxton.\" The dwarf carried the massive block over his head to the cutting stone. He shook his head in disbelief at what was being asked. \"How great the opposition?\"</p> <p>John told him.</p> <p>The dwarf dropped the stone in astonishment and stared at the human and elf. Then he smiled. \"Hah. You know our traditions well, sir knight. You seek to grant me a glorious death leading desperate soldiers against impossible odds.\"</p> <p>\"Not that desperate,\" John said modestly.</p> <p>\"Yes.\" The dwarf looked at Embers again. \"By garb and reputation, I make you A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers, mistress of the Tower of Translation. You are no stranger to power. But your tower is fallen lady,\" he said. \"Seek you revenge? Or justice?\"</p> <p>\"I see no reason to choose,\" Embers said smoothly. \"In my case, as well as the case of these villagers, justice would be revenge.\"</p> <p>The dwarf's head snapped to look at Sir John. \"She speaks my language as well it seems. You are of a kind, you two.\"</p> <p>\"Three,\" John dared.</p> <p>The dwarf failed to stifle a smile. \"And what is your stake in this?\" John shrugged. \"I've already been paid,\" he said. He fished around in a pouch on his belt. \"Here, I'll split it with you, fair and square.\"</p> <p>John flicked a coin off his finger with his thumb. It spun and glinted as it arced across the space between them. The dwarf snatched it from the air, opened his palm and stared at it. Something in his face changed. Softened. He looked at the nearby town that had adopted him. Peasants doing labor in the fields.</p> <p>He clenched his fist around the coin. \"A princely sum,\" he said, mostly to himself.</p> <p>\"You are Dazar,\" Embers dared. \"High theochron in exile. Yours is the greatest dwarven church in all Omund's Land. Thousands look to you for spiritual guidance.\"</p> <p>The dwarf said nothing. He looked at the coin in his hand.</p> <p>\"You left your people,\" Embers said quietly.</p> <p>\"My people left me!\" Dazar barked. \"When they embraced Ajax!\" Embers just watched the dwarf. His rage subsided as quickly as it came.</p> <p>\"I thought \u2026 I thought leaving might inspire my people to \u2026\" He looked at the nearby village. \"Eh, it matters not. I could not have stayed in any event. I lack the stomach for tyranny.\"</p> <p>\"Kal Kalavar's new thane is not an easy problem to solve,\" John said with sympathy. \"Saxton is.\"</p> <p>The dwarf looked up at Embers, \"Her I know by reputation.\" He turned to look at John.</p> <p>John bowed slightly. \"John,\" he said.</p> <p>Dazar looked at his armor, the age and weather of it, and made an intuitive leap. \"You served under the Good King.\"</p> <p>John pursed his lips. \"That was a long time ago.\"</p> <p>Dazar shook his head once. \"Not to me.\" He picked up his battlestaff and stepped forward. \"I knew him, you see. Omund was a fine king. The best we'll see even in a life as long as mine.\"</p> <p>No one spoke for a moment. \"These people,\" Dazar said. \"These villagers. Do they know what they ask?\"</p> <p>John didn't answer.</p> <p>\"Do they know that asking us for help, asking you,\" Dazar looked Sir John up and down \"\u2026 means starting something they must see through to the end? It means hardship, privation, death buying a future for their children? You told them this?\"</p> <p>John shook his head.</p> <p>\"Well why not?!\" Dazar demanded. \"You of all people must understand \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Dazar,\" John said, and his measured voice was a quick counter to Dazar's protest. \"These people are already at their wits' end. Just \u2026 just surviving, putting food on the table, keeping their children warm. Giving them hope. It's already more than should be asked of anyone. And then coming to us, swallowing their pride. Asking us for aid.</p> <p>\"It's our job to understand the job for them.\" Then, quieter, John added, \"And forgive them, ahead of time, for when they weaken, and give in to fear.\"</p> <p>Dazar stared at the man, this knight of Tor, and looked at Embers quietly radiating pride in her friend.</p> <p>\"Hmm,\" Dazar grunted. He opened a pouch on his chest armor and inserted the coin. \"We must find a troubadour, to tell the tale of Saxton's fall. I cannot wait to hear how it ends!\" He walked between them, carrying his staff over his shoulder.</p> <p>\"Come!\" he barked. \"There's a world needs mending! Why stand we here idle?\"</p> <p>John was grinning madly at Embers. She held up three fingers.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#dwarf-traits","title":"Dwarf Traits","text":"<p>Dwarf heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#signature-trait-runic-carving","title":"Signature Trait: Runic Carving","text":"<p>You can carve a rune onto your skin with 10 uninterrupted minutes of work, which is activated by the magic within your body.

Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.</p> <p>\"What if we're going in circles?\"</p> <p>\"Then we keep going in circles!\" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. \"Until we find the elves.\"</p> <p>\"The elves have found you!\" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\" The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They wore a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\"Consort!\" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \"We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\"</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \"They called that one 'consort!'\"</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \"I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\" They indicated the elf who had spoken. \"This is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\"</p> <p>\"How did you know we were here?\" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.</p> <p>\"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\" the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \"And approval,\" Rhythylthin added, clenching his fist and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\"You come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\" Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \"My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\"</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \"But have no fear,\" they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a melody. \"You are safe \u2026 now.\" The pause before \"now\" spoke volumes.</p> <p>\"Are you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \"I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\" they said. Wenna smiled.</p> <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \"Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\" They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. \"Me? I'm old fashioned.\" They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \"Grace never goes out of style.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \"Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\" Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \"You may go.\"</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\"How did they do that?\" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\"Hmm? Do what?\" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\"Just \u2026 disappear like that!\"</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \"Do terran children not play hiding games?\"</p> <p>\"Well \u2026\" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \"We do, but \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \"Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\"</p> <p>\"But that was \u2026\" Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. \"That was magic!\"</p> <p>\"You say? Well,\" Llyander mused, \"terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\" The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \"Come!\" they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\"Where are we going?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>\"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\" Llyander said. \"We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well\u2014likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.\" They smiled.</p> <p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.</p> <p>\"I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.\"</p> <p>The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.</p> <p>Jeremy turned to Dade. \"I feel like we're in a dream,\" he whispered. \"You are!\" their escort called out. \"The wode is a dream!

Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch.

You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. \"We feel very safe.\"</p> <p>\"Who are you kidding?\" Dade said. \"Everyone knows how much elves hate humans.\"</p> <p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\"Show me an elf who hates humans,\" he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \"and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\" He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \"Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.\"</p> <p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.</p> <p>\"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it \u2026\"\u2014he looked at Llyander\u2014\"\u2026 by changing my mind.\"</p> <p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.</p> <p>\"Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught.\" Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. \"But this is not nothing,\" he said. \"We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my grandmother's grandmother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. \"Well, you see children?\" Llyander said. \"We only have more to do, not everything to do.\"</p> <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \"Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew on a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!\"</p> <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p> <p>\"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.</p> <p>\"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my ancient relative labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\" He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p> <p>\"He seems wise,\" Credan said.</p> <p>\"And smart,\" Meliora said.</p> <p>\"I'm surprised how kind he is,\" Jeremy said. \"He seems a good king.\" Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually she couldn't resist. \"What?\"</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\"Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?\" they said, their voice low. \"How astonished you were?\"</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \"This is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\"</p> <p>\"But how do they do \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \"It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind.\"</p> <p>\"You mean they don't even know they're doing it?\" Meliora asked.</p> <p>\"Then what do they really look like?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander shrugged. \"What does anyone really look like?\" And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.</p> <p>The king turned back to them. \"Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.\"</p> <p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. \"Not bad for your second quest.

With Dazar on the other side of it.</p> <p>\"Embers!\" John called out, but the high elf was surrounded. At that moment, a detonation. An explosion of sound that knocked the demons back. And a giant stood before the lumbering egress.</p> <p>Dust settled on the ground behind the giant, and John realized the thunderclap was the sound of the giant running to them. Air that couldn't get out of the way fast enough, tortured by the pressure of his speed.</p> <p>The rectangular, toothed egress demon was twelve feet tall at least, the giant almost matching its immense size.</p> <p>In the instant before the maw of teeth and eyeballs shut, the giant grabbed each side of the mouth, and pulled. Muscles the size of hounds bulged. Tendons like ship cables stood taught, quivering with strain. \"Not today!\" the giant shouted. \"Not TODAY!!\"</p> <p>As the giant forced the maw open, glowing tentacles writhed out of it, wrapping around the giant's arms, legs, neck. \"Hahah!\" the figure laughed. \"You'll find \u2026 MY flesh \u2026\" the giant's bravado hid the fact that he was at the uttermost limits of his strength. \"\u2026 too RICH \u2026 for your taste!\"</p> <p>John knew what the giant did not\u2014the tendrils drained life, sapped energy. The living portal would gain the strength it needed to defeat the giant by drinking his own life force.</p> <p>But the arrival of the giant changed the equation. John saw a new solution. The hakaan risked his life to buy them options, and Sir John of Tor would not let the giant risk his life in vain.</p> <p>Kicking the styrich back gave John room to move, and he dashed toward Embers. A shout, and a thrust into the soulraker's back, and the demons surrounding Embers turned to face Sir John.</p> <p>He had to focus so intently on the demons who now surrounded him, he wasn't even sure Embers knew what to do. But he needn't have worried. When he risked a glance, she was already gone. A light fall of starstuff the only evidence she had translated into void.</p> <p>Dispatching a chimeron, John saw Embers emerge from the other side of the egress demon with Dazar in her arms. John couldn't tell if Dazar was conscious. He might even be dead. Who knew what lurked on the other side of that living portal to the Abyssal Waste?</p> <p>The hakaan struggled against the living gateway to that blasted world. One leg buckled and the stone warrior fell to one knee. The door would take him just as it took their dwarf conduit.</p> <p>Then, rising behind the egress demon, the high theocron, his battlestaff glowing.</p> <p>\"Back!\" Dazar conduit of Zarok, Law-Giver shouted, smashing at the flesh of the living doorway with his battlestaff. \"To hell!\" He swung again.</p> <p>The doorway quivered and bled, and the giant stood up. \"Yes!\" He called out. \"YES!\"</p> <p>John and Embers joined the fight. The gamble, unspoken, was that the summoned demons would evaporate if their living portal were destroyed. It paid off.</p> <p>They only had a moment before the demons swarmed them, but a moment was all it took before the hakaan shouted and finally ripped the bloody egress demon apart with his bare hands.</p> <p>The demons in midstride all turned inside out, leaving bubbling, steaming pools of organs, eyeballs, and teeth on the ground. Leaving four heroes gasping from the fight.</p> <p>\"I told you \u2026\" Dazar said, hands on his knees. \"Not to open! That book!\"</p> <p>\"You didn't say 'Don't open that,'\" John said, leaning back and gulping air. \"You just said it was dangerous. I knew it was dangerous!\"</p> <p>\"Well met!\" The giant laughed at the two friends squabbling.</p> <p>\"Well met indeed,\" Sir John said getting his breathing under control as the group gathered before the giant. \"Thank you for rescuing my friend.\"</p> <p>\"I had the situation under control,\" Dazar muttered, all evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>\"Of a surety!\" The giant's humor matched his size. \"It was my honor to grant thee aid, nothing more.\"</p> <p>\"You've been following us for a while,\" Embers said. John wondered what she meant.</p> <p>\"From the beginning,\" the giant said enigmatically.</p> <p>\"Don't take this the wrong way,\" John confessed, \"but I was afraid we'd meet a barrow-man on this journey.\"</p> <p>The giant smiled \"Fear? At a meeting of friends? Ah these must be treacherous times indeed if simple folk like us have cause to fear meeting strangers.\"</p> <p>\"No offense,\" John said. \"It's just that \u2026 well \u2026 we only ever see one of you when you come down from the hills. Following your doom. Which is usually a \u2026\" John tried to find a less dramatic way to say it, but nothing came to mind. \"A tiding of ill-omen.\"</p> <p>\"You are following your wyrd,\" Embers said.</p> <p>The giant shook his head. \"Following my brother. He hurtles headlong to meet his doom, which I deem is bound up in this matter of this Sky Tyrant.\"</p> <p>\"Ajax,\" Dazar said. And the hakaan could hear the darkness in his voice.</p> <p>\"Aye. I did not understand why his path and yours seemed coincident, but now I think it has something to do with the thing they all seek, his demons.\"</p> <p>John looked at Embers. \"One of the Eleven Who Shall Not Be Named,\" she said. \"The fifth, I suspect. They were the elite deathless servants of the Lord of Swords who once ruled this land, many ages ago. Ajax is collecting the artifacts of ancient emperors. And their servants too, it seems.\"</p> <p>The giant nodded solemnly. \"You are lorewise. My trust in you was well-placed. I am Ardashir,\" he placed one palm on his forehead, the other over his heart, and bowed his head once. \"It would be my pleasure to journey with you awhile. Stalwart allies are rare and precious in these times.\" He grinned. \"Good company even more so.\"</p> <p>\"No armor, no sword or staff,\" Dazar noticed. \"Hakaan do not use weapons?\"</p> <p>\"Many do!\" Ardashir said. \"I do not. I left the hills of my people long ago to pursue a different path. A path of order and discipline. It is my birthright perhaps.\"</p> <p>\"He's a null,\" Embers explained. \"They eschew all weapons and implements of war. It is part of their creed, as I understand it.\"</p> <p>\"Strength alone might serve,\" Dazar nodded, \"when the strength is such as yours.\"</p> <p>Ardashir grinned. \"Strength alone is not enough.\" He assumed a fighting pose, hands clenched, arms in a guarding position before him. \"Discipline, training, focus. These are my implements.\"</p> <p>\"Well you can't ever be disarmed,\" John said. \"That could be useful.\" Ardashir's smile was brilliant. \"I suffice,\" he said.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#hakaan-traits","title":"Hakaan Traits","text":"<p>Hakaan heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#signature-trait-big","title":"Signature Trait: Big!","text":"<p>Your stature reflects your giant forebears.

I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students' names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p> <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class. What do I think of humans?</p> <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, for thirteen centuries. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p> <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Chaos 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt \u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p> <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short\u2014almost as soon as you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p> <p>That refusal to yield to death \u2026 to death \u2026 is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but we learned of many great evils that plagued this world. We met the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, as he opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>We watched Cthrion Uroniziir try to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.1</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led \u2026 by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think \u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world \u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice \u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows.

An inconvenience for troll-kin but to an ogre \u2026\" She indicated the mutated ogre. \"You weren't to know.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, good,\" Sir John said with obvious relief. \"You speak Caelian.\" \"Yes.\" The orc said. She seemed distant. She gave John a look. \"I speak the language of your conquerors.\"</p> <p>John smiled. He liked this orc already.</p> <p>\"By the stars!\" Ardashir said with open joy on his face. \"You saved our lives. It must be you who we seek.\"</p> <p>Khorva looked at the assembled heroes. A motley band. \"You did most of the work,\" she said. She seemed disinterested in them and everything.</p> <p>\"You waited until we proved our mettle before acting!\" Dazar said, and from the way he spoke it was unclear if this was an accusation or mere observation.</p> <p>\"If you couldn't hold your own,\" the orc said, \"there'd be no point helping you.\" Her eyes rested on Sir John.</p> <p>\"John,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Khorva,\" the orc said.</p> <p>\"Of the Howling,\" John said.</p> <p>\"Late of the Howling,\" Khorva said, and looked into the forest with apparent disinterest. Already on the back foot, John thought. Well if it was easy, it wouldn't be called a job.</p> <p>\"We've been looking for you,\" Dazar said.</p> <p>Khorva nodded without looking at the dwarf.</p> <p>\"I surmised as much,\" she said. \"It seemed your plan was to wander around the wood until something tried to kill you in the hopes of attracting my attention.\"</p> <p>\"Well, we didn't have a lot of other options,\" John said. \"We seek the chieftain of the Howling.\"</p> <p>\"That is my brother.\"</p> <p>John looked at Embers. \"We were told the Howling was led by a woman.\"</p> <p>Khorva sighed and looked away into the forest. \"My sister died leaving my people leaderless. I tried to save her. I failed. I tried to lead in her stead. I failed.\" She said these things with no emotion, no inflection. Then her gaze dropped to the sandy ground and her eyes unfocused. A moment passed.</p> <p>\"How clever the dead are,\" she said, her voice a little hollow, \"to torment us from the grave.\"</p> <p>John saw the broken swords on her belt. \"Five swords,\" he said. \"Five broken swords.\" He looked at Khorva anew. \"I don't think I've ever seen an orc survived three challenges.\"</p> <p>\"They couldn't kill me and I wouldn't yield.\" She looked at the group of them skeptically. \"Four of you?\"</p> <p>\"We just got started,\" John said defensively. \"And I'm working on a friend of mine. We'll see. One of the Storm Knights.\"</p> <p>Khorva frowned. \"I thought the Dragon Phalanx were dead.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah well,\" John said, wishing Vaant was here to watch this. \"They couldn't kill him,\" he broke out in a feral grin. \"And he wouldn't yield.\"</p> <p>Khorva nodded once, impressed.</p> <p>\"We need the Howling,\" John said. \"If we get you your tribe back \u2026?\" Khorva sighed and said nothing for several moments. After a while, she returned from her reverie to look at John.</p> <p>\"I'd rather go fishing.\"</p> <p>John smiled. \"My sister liked fishing too.\"</p> <p>\"Why not talk to my brother?\"</p> <p>\"Because we are not fools,\" Embers said, and Khorva locked eyes with her, standing a little straighter. The orc's brown eyes burned and it</p> <p>seemed the group rose somewhat in her estimation. She nodded once. \"The folk of farm and field go to war,\" Dazar said, using the orcish term for humans. \"A war against Lord Saxton and his priest.\"</p> <p>Khorva turned to John. \"How is this your matter?\"</p> <p>John tried to find a way to tell the story that wouldn't take all day. He kicked at a stone with his boot as he thought.</p> <p>\"A family came to me. They're desperate. Their village is desperate. They can either die, or fight. And they cannot fight. So they hired me.\"</p> <p>Khorva raised an eyebrow. \"How much did they buy you for?\" \"Nine copper bits.\"</p> <p>Khorva stared at him. \"That's nothing\"</p> <p>John shrugged. \"It was everything they had. The village sold everything they had left.\"</p> <p>John relaxed as he saw Khorva's eyes soften. She understood.</p> <p>\"A difficult offer to refuse,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Aye.\" Dazar nodded solemly.</p> <p>Khorva looked up to watch three crows idly circling, rising, riding a heat haze into the sky. \"How many is the opposition?\"</p> <p>\"Saxton has no regulars. Just some knights, we can take care of them. But he has the Whitewater. Led by Bonebreaker Dorokor. That's three companies of elite light orc foot against a handful of peasant levies. We need the Howling.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps,\" Khorva said, and turned away from the crows to look out over the heroes. \"I know Dorokor, she is not like my brother. A head of meat and muscle. Dorokor is a thinker. You seek the Howling because you seek a counter to the Whitewater.\" She looked at John. \"But even better, talk to Dorokor. Deny Saxton his pet orc clan, and earn the allegiance of the Whitewater.\"</p> <p>\"Is such a thing possible?\" Embers asked.</p> <p>A moment passed. Khorva didn't break eye contact with John. \"It's possible,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The Howling or the Whitewater tribe,\" Dazar said. \"Either would be a formidable foe in any battle, such is the reputation of orcish warlore.\"</p> <p>Khorva shook her head. \"Orcs have no great love for battle. We love trees and green things. We love an unspoiled land. For this reason did Kul place us in the world. The last of the original speaking peoples.\"</p> <p>\"But also did Kul place the fire within you,\" Embers said.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Dazar added. \"You are not pacifists, you are warriors!\"</p> <p>\"We are pacifists,\" Khorva said with an emphasis that seemed almost a shout. Then a beat of silence and a smile played across her lips. \"And we are warriors.\"</p> <p>\"We're not here to make a deal,\" John said. \"We're not for sale and neither are you. This is about righting a wrong. It's about helping people.\" He paused and something unrehearsed, unbidden came from his lips.</p> <p>\"It's about living with yourself. Sleeping at night.\"</p> <p>\"Battles do not bring restful sleep,\" Khorva said. \"The opposite, I find.\" \"Battles bring glory! Battles make heroes!\" Dazar insisted, and John</p> <p>felt like he learned something about the dwarf in that moment. He could hear that Dazar believed this to be true, and knew it was a lie. It was a test.</p> <p>\"War makes only one thing. Corpses.\" Khorva looked down at the high theochron, who nodded. Test passed.</p> <p>\"And veterans,\" Sir John said. \"Who covet peace.\" Khorva nodded. Respect. \"Aye,\" she said. She looked at each hero then at John again.</p> <p>\"Well,\" she said. \"What do we do next?\"</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#orc-traits","title":"Orc Traits","text":"<p>Orc heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#signature-trait-relentless","title":"Signature Trait: Relentless","text":"<p>Whenever a creature deals damage to you that leaves you dying, you can make a free strike against any creature.

And some people \u2026\"</p> <p>He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table, and now he was mostly talking to himself. \"Some people still have to figure that out.\"</p> <p>\"Which is best?\" Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.</p> <p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. \"Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero,\" he said.</p> <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed. \"Okay.

Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\"</p> <p>\"Where are we going to find three ogres?\" John asked.</p> <p>\"What do you mean?\" Now it was the polder's turn to be confused. \"What do you mean, 'What do I mean?'\" John said.</p> <p>\"I'm not \u2026 we don't need real ogres.\" Jackson looked at the elf. \"Is he for real?\"</p> <p>\"Trust me,\" the void mage said.</p> <p>\"You mean you're going to make it up?!\" John exclaimed.</p> <p>\"I \u2026\" Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \"Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?\" he asked the elf.</p> <p>\"He'll learn.\" Embers smiled.</p> <p>The polder turned back to Sir John. \"Hello. I lie for a living. And I'm really good at it.

I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\"</p> <p>\"Propaganda,\" Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p> <p>\"Hey,\" the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \"Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right.

The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the church.</p> <p>\"Is it that your brain is so small you must talk in order to think?\" The woman's smile was a sneer.</p> <p>Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. \"You are going to die in any event,\" he said. \"If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.\"</p> <p>Up close, she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.</p> <p>\"You seem to be made of bits,\" the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. \"And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of castoff scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.\"</p> <p>The taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blond.</p> <p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. \"Where is your worldship?\" he said in a more reasonable voice. \"Or came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?\" At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise. \"You see?\" the taxiarch said, impressed with himself. \"I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien.\" He nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. \"I am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.\" Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. \"If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.\"</p> <p>The alien sighed. \"'Blaap blaap blaap,'\" she said. \"You should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble.\" She nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p> <p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p> <p>\"Look how easily this one is goaded!\" she said. She spat out dark-blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \"You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these \u2026 bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps from the air,\" Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \"I could scout the forest around the \u2026\"</p> <p>\"No!\" Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the Hawklord and strode toward her. \"You are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one \u2026\" he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \"\u2026 will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\" He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p> <p>\"They may pull you apart,\" he said to her, and at this his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\"Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\" At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\"Shall I let you choose?\" the taxiarch said, and drew a dagger from his belt. \"I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then \u2026\"</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\"\u2026 should be ready for anything,\" one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the Hawklord, and the taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\"Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\" another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and seven heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A dwarf with his battle-staff tipped with an hourglass. An orc with a huge battleaxe casually resting on her shoulder. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. An unarmed hakaan towering over everyone. And a dragon knight. Of all the motley band, it was the dragon knight who caused the people of the town to gasp. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the taxiarch bellowed \"Hold fast!\" and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them against the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>The hakaan looked around and saw a clump of villagers watching the scene from a distance, gathered around what looked like some stables. He waved. \"Hello!\" he said, smiling.</p> <p>One of the villagers waved back before being shushed.</p> <p>John looked at the taxiarch and immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\"What's this?\" the taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \"Allies of the alien?\" He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>\"Allies of all those who suffer, and seek justice,\" the dwarf announced. Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \"Embers?\"</p> <p>\"A kuran'zoi,\" the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \"A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\"</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers explicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out. All he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the taxiarch didn't react. That spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\"She goes free,\" John commanded, his voice steel, \"or you die here.\" He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\"I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\" The war dog taxiarch looked at the elf, giant, polder, dwarf, and dragon knight. \"Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you \u2026\"\u2014his voice lowered almost to a whisper\u2014\"\u2026 to be on the winning side for a change.\"</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>John felt his skin tighten as Dazar warded him, and from the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one saw him move from where he'd been a moment before.</p> <p>The hakaan burst into action and sped past him like a blur.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in his heart\u2014the clarion call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>At the sound, the orc dashed forward into a knot of wardog commandos, her axe already hewing about her.</p> <p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword and falchion. \"All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\" He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the shortsword on his belt.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#time-raider-traits","title":"Time Raider Traits","text":"<p>Time raider heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Draw%20Steel%20Heroes%20-%20Unlinked/#signature-trait-psychic-scar","title":"Signature Trait: Psychic Scar","text":"<p>Your mind is a formidable layer of defense.

Then he relit it from another candle.</p> <p>Stepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He'd spent his last coppers on the candles\u2014they weren't cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said a skull\u2014it didn't even specify a human skull! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual know if the skull was real?</p> <p>He was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help.

Yes, finally.\" The creature rubbed his hands together. \"It's about time,\" he said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. \"Now then! How does it go?

Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.</p> <p>\"Nono. Nurse!\" the devil called out. \"Doctor?! Is anyone \u2026 you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some \u2026 some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always \u2026\"</p> <p>Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.</p> <p>\"\u2026 calms me down,\" the devil said quietly.</p> <p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch blackness. The devil's hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. \"Um,\" he said to the empty room. \"Uh-oh.\"</p> <p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor.

A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village.

Do they speak Caelian in Hell?\"</p> <p>\"What a good question. Unless it's very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language.

Not very professional, I can tell you that.\"</p> <p>\"No cloud of brimstone now?\" she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \"Style counts for something.\"</p> <p>\"But wait, that was \u2026\" She did some quick mental math. \"Fifteen years ago?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\" \"An accountant!\"</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \"It's what I did before.

A typical clutch yields only a single egg. After only a few generations, these draconians begin to show new adaptations like feathers or frilled ridges.</p> <p>The largest extant population of draconians is the remnants of the Dragon Phalanx in Vasloria. Created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae, the Dragon Phalanx once numbered several thousand of the king's greatest knights, ensuring the rule of law across the land.</p> <p>Knighthood was a title carried by every member of that first generation of dragon knights. Within the Dragon Phalanx were shadows, censors, tacticians, and elementalists. Members of virtually every heroic vocation could be found in one of the eight dragonflights that made up the phalanx. For over 30 years, these heroes were symbols of justice, protecting the weak from the strong, and standing between the common folk and those who sought power over others.

As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.</p> <p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.</p> <p>The three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered\u2014then, sensing his human compatriots' reluctance, turned to look at them. \"What's this?\" the lead dwarf growled.</p> <p>Looking at the dragon knight, another bandit added quickly, \"We didn't know there was one of you here.\"</p> <p>The draconian didn't move. Didn't give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf. \"Think of the bounty,\" the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. \"We'll all be rich.\"</p> <p>The two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren't afraid anymore.</p> <p>\"We'll be back,\" the lead dwarf said, and the group of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.</p> <p>As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. \"Show's over,\" he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.</p> <p>A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. \"Excuse me, sir knight,\" the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.</p> <p>The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.</p> <p>The man touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed. \"Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin' for you.\"</p> <p>The dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. \"Look for someone else,\" he growled as he pulled his arm away.</p> <p>The man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. \"I'm sorry sir, but there ain't no one else. There's this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he's of Saint Ajax.\"</p> <p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away\u2014when someone else spoke.</p> <p>\"You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant,\" said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p> <p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who'd spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.</p> <p>\"John?\"</p> <p>The man turned to look up.</p> <p>\"Hi Vaant,\" he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middleaged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons. \"Folks,\" he said, \"this is Vaantikalisax, knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights.\"</p> <p>The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. \"What are you doing out here?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"These people need help. I said I'd find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.\"</p> <p>The draconian sniffed, released John's hand. \"Sure,\" he said. \"But why me?\"</p> <p>\"Thought maybe you'd like to get back in the game.\"</p> <p>\"The game.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\" Sir John smiled. \"The hero game.\"</p> <p>The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently.

But I have this feeling that's how it'll end.\"</p> <p>\"What does your oath say? 'Even should the sun stop in the sky, even should the night\u2014'\"</p> <p>\"John,\" the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad. Exasperated. \"You don't want to quote my oath to me. You really don't. I liked serving with you. I have fond memories of that time\u2014of you. Don't spoil it.\" He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.</p> <p>\"Vaant,\" Sir John said, following. \"Sir Vaantikalisax, by your oath!\" The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p> <p>\"The people need leadership,\" John said.</p> <p>Vaantikalisax's reptile eyes flashed in anger. \"They had it! Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax \u2026 I watched him \u2026\" The dragon knight's eyes flinched.

The stones smoked as they fell, and the copper saw glowed with heat.</p> <p>John and Embers watched silently as the dwarf hefted another massive stone onto the cutting block.</p> <p>The dwarf spit into his hands and noticed the two out of the corner of his eye.

I have heard of this one,\" the dwarf said, seemingly uninterested. He hurled the smaller blocks into a pile and went to heft a new stone to cut. \"A foul tyrant. Well-suited to these times. Perhaps the people deserve him.\"</p> <p>\"No people deserve tyranny,\" Embers said, an edge in her voice. The dwarf appeared to notice her for the first time, peered at her, took in her raiment, and went back to work. \"Nine against Saxton.\" The dwarf carried the massive block over his head to the cutting stone. He shook his head in disbelief at what was being asked. \"How great the opposition?\"</p> <p>John told him.</p> <p>The dwarf dropped the stone in astonishment and stared at the human and elf.

You are no stranger to power. But your tower is fallen lady,\" he said. \"Seek you revenge? Or justice?\"</p> <p>\"I see no reason to choose,\" Embers said smoothly. \"In my case, as well as the case of these villagers, justice would be revenge.\"</p> <p>The dwarf's head snapped to look at Sir John. \"She speaks my language as well it seems. You are of a kind, you two.\"</p> <p>\"Three,\" John dared.</p> <p>The dwarf failed to stifle a smile. \"And what is your stake in this?\" John shrugged. \"I've already been paid,\" he said. He fished around in a pouch on his belt. \"Here, I'll split it with you, fair and square.\"</p> <p>John flicked a coin off his finger with his thumb. It spun and glinted as it arced across the space between them. The dwarf snatched it from the air, opened his palm and stared at it. Something in his face changed. Softened. He looked at the nearby town that had adopted him. Peasants doing labor in the fields.</p> <p>He clenched his fist around the coin. \"A princely sum,\" he said, mostly to himself.</p> <p>\"You are Dazar,\" Embers dared. \"High theochron in exile. Yours is the greatest dwarven church in all Omund's Land. Thousands look to you for spiritual guidance.\"</p> <p>The dwarf said nothing. He looked at the coin in his hand.</p> <p>\"You left your people,\" Embers said quietly.</p> <p>\"My people left me!\" Dazar barked. \"When they embraced Ajax!\" Embers just watched the dwarf. His rage subsided as quickly as it came.</p> <p>\"I thought \u2026 I thought leaving might inspire my people to \u2026\" He looked at the nearby village. \"Eh, it matters not.

Omund was a fine king. The best we'll see even in a life as long as mine.\"</p> <p>No one spoke for a moment. \"These people,\" Dazar said. \"These villagers. Do they know what they ask?\"</p> <p>John didn't answer.</p> <p>\"Do they know that asking us for help, asking you,\" Dazar looked Sir John up and down \"\u2026 means starting something they must see through to the end?

You told them this?\"</p> <p>John shook his head.</p> <p>\"Well why not?!\" Dazar demanded. \"You of all people must understand \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Dazar,\" John said, and his measured voice was a quick counter to Dazar's protest. \"These people are already at their wits' end. Just \u2026 just surviving, putting food on the table, keeping their children warm. Giving them hope. It's already more than should be asked of anyone. And then coming to us, swallowing their pride.

He hurtles headlong to meet his doom, which I deem is bound up in this matter of this Sky Tyrant.\"</p> <p>\"Ajax,\" Dazar said. And the hakaan could hear the darkness in his voice.</p> <p>\"Aye. I did not understand why his path and yours seemed coincident, but now I think it has something to do with the thing they all seek, his demons.\"</p> <p>John looked at Embers. \"One of the Eleven Who Shall Not Be Named,\" she said. \"The fifth, I suspect. They were the elite deathless servants of the Lord of Swords who once ruled this land, many ages ago. Ajax is collecting the artifacts of ancient emperors. And their servants too, it seems.\"</p> <p>The giant nodded solemnly. \"You are lorewise. My trust in you was well-placed. I am Ardashir,\" he placed one palm on his forehead, the other over his heart, and bowed his head once. \"It would be my pleasure to journey with you awhile. Stalwart allies are rare and precious in these times.\" He grinned. \"Good company even more so.\"</p> <p>\"No armor, no sword or staff,\" Dazar noticed. \"Hakaan do not use weapons?\"</p> <p>\"Many do!\" Ardashir said. \"I do not. I left the hills of my people long ago to pursue a different path. A path of order and discipline. It is my birthright perhaps.\"</p> <p>\"He's a null,\" Embers explained. \"They eschew all weapons and implements of war. It is part of their creed, as I understand it.\"</p> <p>\"Strength alone might serve,\" Dazar nodded, \"when the strength is such as yours.\"</p> <p>Ardashir grinned. \"Strength alone is not enough.\" He assumed a fighting pose, hands clenched, arms in a guarding position before him. \"Discipline, training, focus. These are my implements.\"</p> <p>\"Well you can't ever be disarmed,\" John said. \"That could be useful.\" Ardashir's smile was brilliant. \"I suffice,\" he said.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Ancestries/Hakaan/#hakaan-traits","title":"Hakaan Traits","text":"<p>Hakaan heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Ancestries/Hakaan/#signature-trait-big","title":"Signature Trait: Big!","text":"<p>Your stature reflects your giant forebears.

Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch.

You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. \"We feel very safe.\"</p> <p>\"Who are you kidding?\" Dade said. \"Everyone knows how much elves hate humans.\"</p> <p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\"Show me an elf who hates humans,\" he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \"and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\" He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \"Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.\"</p> <p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.</p> <p>\"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it \u2026\"\u2014he looked at Llyander\u2014\"\u2026 by changing my mind.\"</p> <p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.</p> <p>\"Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught.\" Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. \"But this is not nothing,\" he said. \"We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my grandmother's grandmother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. \"Well, you see children?\" Llyander said. \"We only have more to do, not everything to do.\"</p> <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \"Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew on a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!\"</p> <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p> <p>\"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.</p> <p>\"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my ancient relative labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\" He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p> <p>\"He seems wise,\" Credan said.</p> <p>\"And smart,\" Meliora said.</p> <p>\"I'm surprised how kind he is,\" Jeremy said. \"He seems a good king.\" Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually she couldn't resist. \"What?\"</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\"Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?\" they said, their voice low. \"How astonished you were?\"</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \"This is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\"</p> <p>\"But how do they do \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \"It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind.\"</p> <p>\"You mean they don't even know they're doing it?\" Meliora asked.</p> <p>\"Then what do they really look like?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander shrugged. \"What does anyone really look like?\" And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.</p> <p>The king turned back to them. \"Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.\"</p> <p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. \"Not bad for your second quest.

Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Chaos 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt \u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life.

Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but we learned of many great evils that plagued this world. We met the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, as he opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>We watched Cthrion Uroniziir try to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.1</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led \u2026 by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think \u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world \u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice \u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes.

An inconvenience for troll-kin but to an ogre \u2026\" She indicated the mutated ogre. \"You weren't to know.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, good,\" Sir John said with obvious relief. \"You speak Caelian.\" \"Yes.\" The orc said. She seemed distant. She gave John a look. \"I speak the language of your conquerors.\"</p> <p>John smiled. He liked this orc already.</p> <p>\"By the stars!\" Ardashir said with open joy on his face. \"You saved our lives. It must be you who we seek.\"</p> <p>Khorva looked at the assembled heroes. A motley band. \"You did most of the work,\" she said. She seemed disinterested in them and everything.</p> <p>\"You waited until we proved our mettle before acting!\" Dazar said, and from the way he spoke it was unclear if this was an accusation or mere observation.</p> <p>\"If you couldn't hold your own,\" the orc said, \"there'd be no point helping you.\" Her eyes rested on Sir John.</p> <p>\"John,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Khorva,\" the orc said.</p> <p>\"Of the Howling,\" John said.</p> <p>\"Late of the Howling,\" Khorva said, and looked into the forest with apparent disinterest. Already on the back foot, John thought. Well if it was easy, it wouldn't be called a job.</p> <p>\"We've been looking for you,\" Dazar said.</p> <p>Khorva nodded without looking at the dwarf.</p> <p>\"I surmised as much,\" she said. \"It seemed your plan was to wander around the wood until something tried to kill you in the hopes of attracting my attention.\"</p> <p>\"Well, we didn't have a lot of other options,\" John said. \"We seek the chieftain of the Howling.\"</p> <p>\"That is my brother.\"</p> <p>John looked at Embers. \"We were told the Howling was led by a woman.\"</p> <p>Khorva sighed and looked away into the forest. \"My sister died leaving my people leaderless. I tried to save her. I failed. I tried to lead in her stead. I failed.\" She said these things with no emotion, no inflection. Then her gaze dropped to the sandy ground and her eyes unfocused. A moment passed.</p> <p>\"How clever the dead are,\" she said, her voice a little hollow, \"to torment us from the grave.\"</p> <p>John saw the broken swords on her belt. \"Five swords,\" he said. \"Five broken swords.\" He looked at Khorva anew. \"I don't think I've ever seen an orc survived three challenges.\"</p> <p>\"They couldn't kill me and I wouldn't yield.\" She looked at the group of them skeptically. \"Four of you?\"</p> <p>\"We just got started,\" John said defensively. \"And I'm working on a friend of mine. We'll see. One of the Storm Knights.\"</p> <p>Khorva frowned. \"I thought the Dragon Phalanx were dead.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah well,\" John said, wishing Vaant was here to watch this. \"They couldn't kill him,\" he broke out in a feral grin. \"And he wouldn't yield.\"</p> <p>Khorva nodded once, impressed.</p> <p>\"We need the Howling,\" John said. \"If we get you your tribe back \u2026?\" Khorva sighed and said nothing for several moments.

The orc's brown eyes burned and it</p> <p>seemed the group rose somewhat in her estimation. She nodded once. \"The folk of farm and field go to war,\" Dazar said, using the orcish term for humans. \"A war against Lord Saxton and his priest.\"</p> <p>Khorva turned to John. \"How is this your matter?\"</p> <p>John tried to find a way to tell the story that wouldn't take all day. He kicked at a stone with his boot as he thought.</p> <p>\"A family came to me. They're desperate. Their village is desperate. They can either die, or fight. And they cannot fight. So they hired me.\"</p> <p>Khorva raised an eyebrow. \"How much did they buy you for?\" \"Nine copper bits.\"</p> <p>Khorva stared at him. \"That's nothing\"</p> <p>John shrugged. \"It was everything they had. The village sold everything they had left.\"</p> <p>John relaxed as he saw Khorva's eyes soften. She understood.</p> <p>\"A difficult offer to refuse,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Aye.\" Dazar nodded solemly.</p> <p>Khorva looked up to watch three crows idly circling, rising, riding a heat haze into the sky. \"How many is the opposition?\"</p> <p>\"Saxton has no regulars. Just some knights, we can take care of them. But he has the Whitewater. Led by Bonebreaker Dorokor. That's three companies of elite light orc foot against a handful of peasant levies. We need the Howling.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps,\" Khorva said, and turned away from the crows to look out over the heroes. \"I know Dorokor, she is not like my brother. A head of meat and muscle. Dorokor is a thinker. You seek the Howling because you seek a counter to the Whitewater.\" She looked at John. \"But even better, talk to Dorokor. Deny Saxton his pet orc clan, and earn the allegiance of the Whitewater.\"</p> <p>\"Is such a thing possible?\" Embers asked.</p> <p>A moment passed. Khorva didn't break eye contact with John. \"It's possible,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The Howling or the Whitewater tribe,\" Dazar said. \"Either would be a formidable foe in any battle, such is the reputation of orcish warlore.\"</p> <p>Khorva shook her head. \"Orcs have no great love for battle. We love trees and green things. We love an unspoiled land. For this reason did Kul place us in the world. The last of the original speaking peoples.\"</p> <p>\"But also did Kul place the fire within you,\" Embers said.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Dazar added. \"You are not pacifists, you are warriors!\"</p> <p>\"We are pacifists,\" Khorva said with an emphasis that seemed almost a shout. Then a beat of silence and a smile played across her lips. \"And we are warriors.\"</p> <p>\"We're not here to make a deal,\" John said. \"We're not for sale and neither are you. This is about righting a wrong. It's about helping people.\" He paused and something unrehearsed, unbidden came from his lips.</p> <p>\"It's about living with yourself. Sleeping at night.\"</p> <p>\"Battles do not bring restful sleep,\" Khorva said. \"The opposite, I find.\" \"Battles bring glory! Battles make heroes!\" Dazar insisted, and John</p> <p>felt like he learned something about the dwarf in that moment. He could hear that Dazar believed this to be true, and knew it was a lie. It was a test.</p> <p>\"War makes only one thing. Corpses.\" Khorva looked down at the high theochron, who nodded. Test passed.</p> <p>\"And veterans,\" Sir John said. \"Who covet peace.\" Khorva nodded. Respect. \"Aye,\" she said.

A clatter of</p> <p>weapons hitting the floor. Three pairs of hands slowly rose in the air. \"Good boys.

The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the church.</p> <p>\"Is it that your brain is so small you must talk in order to think?\" The woman's smile was a sneer.</p> <p>Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. \"You are going to die in any event,\" he said. \"If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.\"</p> <p>Up close, she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.</p> <p>\"You seem to be made of bits,\" the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. \"And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of castoff scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.\"</p> <p>The taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blond.</p> <p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. \"Where is your worldship?\" he said in a more reasonable voice. \"Or came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?\" At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise. \"You see?\" the taxiarch said, impressed with himself. \"I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien.\" He nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. \"I am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.\" Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. \"If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.\"</p> <p>The alien sighed. \"'Blaap blaap blaap,'\" she said. \"You should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble.\" She nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p> <p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p> <p>\"Look how easily this one is goaded!\" she said. She spat out dark-blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \"You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these \u2026 bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps from the air,\" Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \"I could scout the forest around the \u2026\"</p> <p>\"No!\" Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the Hawklord and strode toward her. \"You are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one \u2026\" he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \"\u2026 will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\" He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p> <p>\"They may pull you apart,\" he said to her, and at this his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\"Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\" At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\"Shall I let you choose?\" the taxiarch said, and drew a dagger from his belt. \"I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then \u2026\"</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\"\u2026 should be ready for anything,\" one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the Hawklord, and the taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\"Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\" another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and seven heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A dwarf with his battle-staff tipped with an hourglass. An orc with a huge battleaxe casually resting on her shoulder. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. An unarmed hakaan towering over everyone. And a dragon knight. Of all the motley band, it was the dragon knight who caused the people of the town to gasp. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the taxiarch bellowed \"Hold fast!\" and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them against the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>The hakaan looked around and saw a clump of villagers watching the scene from a distance, gathered around what looked like some stables. He waved. \"Hello!\" he said, smiling.</p> <p>One of the villagers waved back before being shushed.</p> <p>John looked at the taxiarch and immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\"What's this?\" the taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \"Allies of the alien?\" He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>\"Allies of all those who suffer, and seek justice,\" the dwarf announced. Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \"Embers?\"</p> <p>\"A kuran'zoi,\" the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \"A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\"</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers explicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out. All he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the taxiarch didn't react. That spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\"She goes free,\" John commanded, his voice steel, \"or you die here.\" He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\"I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\" The war dog taxiarch looked at the elf, giant, polder, dwarf, and dragon knight. \"Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you \u2026\"\u2014his voice lowered almost to a whisper\u2014\"\u2026 to be on the winning side for a change.\"</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>John felt his skin tighten as Dazar warded him, and from the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one saw him move from where he'd been a moment before.</p> <p>The hakaan burst into action and sped past him like a blur.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in his heart\u2014the clarion call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>At the sound, the orc dashed forward into a knot of wardog commandos, her axe already hewing about her.</p> <p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword and falchion. \"All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\" He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the shortsword on his belt.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Ancestries/Time%20Raider/#time-raider-traits","title":"Time Raider Traits","text":"<p>Time raider heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Ancestries/Time%20Raider/#signature-trait-psychic-scar","title":"Signature Trait: Psychic Scar","text":"<p>Your mind is a formidable layer of defense.

Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.</p> <p>\"What if we're going in circles?\"</p> <p>\"Then we keep going in circles!\" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. \"Until we find the elves.\"</p> <p>\"The elves have found you!\" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\" The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They wore a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\"Consort!\" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \"We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\"</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \"They called that one 'consort!'\"</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \"I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\" They indicated the elf who had spoken. \"This is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\"</p> <p>\"How did you know we were here?\" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.</p> <p>\"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\" the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \"And approval,\" Rhythylthin added, clenching his fist and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\"You come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\" Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \"My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\"</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \"But have no fear,\" they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a melody. \"You are safe \u2026 now.\" The pause before \"now\" spoke volumes.</p> <p>\"Are you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \"I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\" they said. Wenna smiled.</p> <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \"Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\" They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. \"Me? I'm old fashioned.\" They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \"Grace never goes out of style.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \"Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\" Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \"You may go.\"</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\"How did they do that?\" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\"Hmm? Do what?\" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\"Just \u2026 disappear like that!\"</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \"Do terran children not play hiding games?\"</p> <p>\"Well \u2026\" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \"We do, but \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \"Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\"</p> <p>\"But that was \u2026\" Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. \"That was magic!\"</p> <p>\"You say? Well,\" Llyander mused, \"terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\" The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \"Come!\" they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\"Where are we going?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>\"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\" Llyander said. \"We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well\u2014likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.\" They smiled.</p> <p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.</p> <p>\"I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.\"</p> <p>The children nodded.

Among them are devils, dwarves, elves, time raiders\u2014and of course humans, whose culture and history dominates many worlds.</p> <p>Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn't grant you cultural benefits, such as crafting or lore skills, though. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.</p> <p>In Draw Steel, ancestry describes how you were born. Culture (part of Chapter 4: Background) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!</p> <p>This chapter details twelve ancestries for the game:</p> <p>Devil: Devils originated in the Seven Cities of Hell and have a supernatural charisma that helps them persuade others. They are similar in stature to humans, and their skin tones include deep blues, purples, and reds. They sport horns, eyes of all shades (including gold and red), and tails, and some have feathered or leathery wings.</p> <p>Dragon Knight: Dragon knights are muscled draconic humanoids who stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. The scales covering their reptilian heads, bodies, and tails can be almost any color. All dragon knights have wings, but on only a few are those wings big enough to let them fly.</p> <p>Dwarf: Humanoids with stony skin, dwarves have short and stout bodies. Many carve supernatural runes into their flesh, and some have beards made of crystals.</p> <p>Wode Elf: Lithe humanoids with finely furred skin in all shades of blue, wode elves have angular features and large, pointed ears akin to a bat's. They possess a supernatural glamor that allows them to blend in with their surroundings when they wish to hide.</p> <p>High Elf: Stately and graceful, high elves have tall, willowy bodies, pointed ears, and smoother skin than most other humanoids. Rare metal inlays such as gold, platinum, palladium, and iridium act as organic components within their skin. The truest form of any high elf is hidden from most\u2014sometimes even from themself\u2014thanks to a supernatural glamor that makes them more attractive to others, whatever that might mean to an individual. This glamor transcends physical appearance, also slightly altering a high elf's tone and smell.</p> <p>Hakaan: Descended from stone giants, the mighty hakaan stand over 9 feet tall and have well-muscled bodies made of organic stone. They are the largest ancestry in this book!</p> <p>Human: Humans are the most numerous people in Orden and many other fantasy worlds! In Draw Steel, humans have all the diversity that our species displays in real life\u2014and they can sense the presence of supernatural energy!</p> <p>Memonek: Originating on Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek are a machine people made of metal, marble, glass, and other inorganic materials. Their bodies are lightweight, making them easier to move and letting them fall at slower speeds.</p> <p>Orc: Orcs have skin in green tones and stand slightly taller and wider than humans. A supernatural energy they call \"the blood fire\" flows through their veins, igniting colorful lines in an orc's skin during life-ordeath battles.</p> <p>Polder: The smallest of the ancestries in this book, polders stand no taller than 3-1/2 feet. They look like smaller humans, and they have the ability to blend in with the shadows.</p> <p>Revenant: No hero starts their life as a revenant. Rather, these undead creatures return to the world of the living because they have dire business that must be finished. A character of any ancestry can become a revenant.</p> <p>Time Raider: Travelers of the timescape, the time raiders (or kuran'zoi as they call themselves) have four arms and a single ocular sensor instead of a pair of eyes. Many have innate psionic abilities that make them capable warriors.</p> <p>Other Sections</p> <p>The rules for using ancestries refer to lots of other parts of the game. You can find information on specific topics as follows:</p> <p>Edges and banes, Recoveries, respites: Chapter 1: The Basics</p> <p>Languages: Chapter 4: Background</p> <p>Abilities, conditions, potencies, saving throws, surges: Chapter 5: Classes</p> <p>Skills, tests: Chapter 9: Tests</p> <p>Crafting projects: Chapter 12: Downtime Projects</p> <p>Main actions and maneuvers, creature size, damage and Stamina, dying and death, flanking, movement and forced movement, winded: Chapter 10: Combat</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#on-the-origin-of-species","title":"On the Origin of Species","text":"<p>Orden (talked about in Chapter 1: The Basics) is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. \"I dunno, a god did it probably.\"</p> <p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons, all have creator gods\u2014the Elder Gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.</p> <p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent, species petered out after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.</p> <p>It may be all species were created by gods. That's certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won't ever. There's still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren't evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.</p> <p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.</p> <p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.</p> <p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfired. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral iridoss, known as prismacore, that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually their science and magics produced the omnivok\u2014machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves they stopped their work and gave their creations full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p> <p>Normally, it doesn't work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed 30 years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.</p> <p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.</p> <p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent species, it's for less-than-virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran'zoi\u2014the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and who carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.</p> <p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening, used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn't create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angulotls walking around having conversations with each other,</p> <p>wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn't get moldy in the swamp.</p> <p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! \"You didn't create angulotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!\"</p> <p>This is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.</p> <p>At the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and replace it with something you made up, it will be better. Because it's yours!</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#names-by-ancestry","title":"Names by Ancestry","text":"<p>Obviously you're free to invent whatever name you want for your character!

They do not have and do not use last names or family names. Everyone in the village knows who you mean when you refer to \"William.\" Even if there's more than one William in the village, you can usually tell who someone's referring to from context. Sometimes folks prepend \"our\" to someone's name meaning: the one related to or otherwise concerned with me and my family. \"Our William\" for instance.</p> <p>If that's not enough, folks use another identifier known as a byname. If there were two boys in the village named Much, one of them might be called Much the Miller's Son, to distinguish them from the other lad.</p> <p>If you leave your village regularly, say to trade with others in a distant market, then your byname might be the place you're from. Alan from the village in the dale, might become known as Alan from the Dale, or even Alan-a-Dale. But everyone back home just calls you Alan.</p> <p>A byname might refer to your profession. Clyde the Cartwright is a perfectly normal byname. But no one you met would assume \"Cartwright\" was your 'family name.' People who live permanently in a very large city like Capital use family names, because almost no first name is sufficiently unique to identify you, and \"Marissa the Cartwright's Daughter\" quickly evolves into Marissa Cartwright.</p> <p>Most nobles in Orden also use the name of the area they rule as part of their name. When someone refers to Lord Edmund Bedegar everyone listening silently, without thinking about it, adds \"of\" between the name and the place. Edmund is both Edmund, and the Lord of Bedegar, and Edmund, Lord of Bedegar, and therefore sometimes Lord Edmund Bedegar. Even though \"Bedegar\" looks like a \"last name\" to us, and is being used in that manner sometimes, it's not exactly his last name. It's still just another kind of byname.</p> <p>Unlike remote villages, well settled areas where many towns and villages are all networked by roads often do use surnames to help differentiate one William from the other twenty within a densely populated area.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#names-and-gender","title":"Names and Gender","text":"<p>Most cultures in Vasloria make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, though not all do. And for some cultures that make such a distinction, almost no one outside the culture can tell the difference.</p> <p>Among those cultures which do make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, there are always names that could refer to a person of any gender. Here in the real world, you can't tell a person's gender just from the name \"Shane.\" This is mostly because which names are considered masculine or feminine changes over time, and when this happens, there's a period\u2014maybe a few generations\u2014where the name could refer to a person of any gender.</p> <p>Of course, there's no law (neither metaphorically nor literally) that requires your character to go by their birth name. They might not even know their birth name depending on what happened after they were born. It's not unusual, especially among talents, for a hero to adopt a moniker or sobriquet instead of a name. And in some cultures, there's a tradition of changing your name\u2014or at least how you prefer to be known\u2014as you go through different stages of life. High elves sometimes adopt a wholly new name when they reach a certain age, or more commonly, they choose a different component of their name.

It was either going to work, or it wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help. He opened the book and turned the page\u2014then began to speak the ritual.</p> <p>Moments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared \u2026 there was a devil standing in his basement\u2014dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.</p> <p>\"Aha! Yes, finally.\" The creature rubbed his hands together. \"It's about time,\" he said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. \"Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes.\" He cleared his throat. \"On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you \u2026\" But his speech fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>\"It worked!\" Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. \"Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after years! I will have my revenge! Hahaha \u2026! *cough* *cough*\" Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing.</p> <p>\"Dismiss me from service, will they?! *cough* Old and useless \u2026 am I?! I'll show them!\" He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. \"I will hex them and torture them until they \u2026\"</p> <p>He stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. \"Until they \u2026 until \u2026\" He clutched his chest.</p> <p>\"Uh-oh,\" the devil said, genuinely worried.</p> <p>\"HNNG!\" Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.</p> <p>\"Nono. Nurse!\" the devil called out. \"Doctor?! Is anyone \u2026 you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some \u2026 some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always \u2026\"</p> <p>Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.</p> <p>\"\u2026 calms me down,\" the devil said quietly.</p> <p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch blackness. The devil's hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. \"Um,\" he said to the empty room. \"Uh-oh.\"</p> <p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.</p> <p>He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.</p> <p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack, on the outskirts of a small village opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.</p> <p>\"Ah,\" the devil said.</p> <p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.</p> <p>\"Oh! Good day to you, madam. I wonder if you could tell me \u2026\"</p> <p>\"AAAHHHHH!!!\" she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.</p> <p>\"Ah. Um. Hmm.\"</p> <p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.</p> <p>\"Have at you, devil!\" he said, assuming something like a dueling pose. \"I say! Steady on!\" The devil raised his hands.</p> <p>The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.</p> <p>Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.</p> <p>\u2022 \"And that's how I ended up here!\" Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. \"Now, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!\"</p> <p>\"Legendarily vain,\" his dinner guest teased with a smile.</p> <p>\"Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don't they?\"</p> <p>She laughed. \"Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as advertised.\"</p> <p>\"Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady.\"</p> <p>\"Not all actors are vain.\" She took offense beautifully. \"Just the good ones.\" She sipped her drink.</p> <p>\"Well then, you must be very vain indeed,\" the devil said. \"Anyway, does that answer your question?\"</p> <p>\"Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in Hell?\"</p> <p>\"What a good question. Unless it's very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I'm sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.\"</p> <p>\"No cloud of brimstone now?\" she teased.</p> <p>He waggled his eyebrows. \"Style counts for something.\"</p> <p>\"But wait, that was \u2026\" She did some quick mental math. \"Fifteen years ago?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\" \"An accountant!\"</p> <p>Riyalkin shrugged. \"It's what I did before. I'm moderately good at it.\" \"And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?\"</p> <p>\"Well \u2026\" Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. \"It's just that \u2026 the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body. And I guess I just \u2026 missed the excitement.\"</p> <p>\"The excitement of being an accountant.\"</p> <p>\"The excitement of being an accountant in Hell,\" Riyalkin said. \"In any event, enough about me and the thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste</p> <p>and the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel underdressed in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is it that any outfit is improved by your unearthly beauty?\"</p> <p>She blushed in spite of herself and raised her own glass in a toast. \"You silver-tongued devil.\"</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#devil-traits","title":"Devil Traits","text":"<p>Devil heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#signature-trait-silver-tongue","title":"Signature Trait: Silver Tongue","text":"<p>Your innate magic allows you to twist how your words are perceived to get a better read on people and convince them to see things your way.

As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.</p> <p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.</p> <p>The three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered\u2014then, sensing his human compatriots' reluctance, turned to look at them. \"What's this?\" the lead dwarf growled.</p> <p>Looking at the dragon knight, another bandit added quickly, \"We didn't know there was one of you here.\"</p> <p>The draconian didn't move. Didn't give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf. \"Think of the bounty,\" the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. \"We'll all be rich.\"</p> <p>The two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren't afraid anymore.</p> <p>\"We'll be back,\" the lead dwarf said, and the group of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.</p> <p>As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. \"Show's over,\" he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.</p> <p>A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. \"Excuse me, sir knight,\" the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.</p> <p>The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.</p> <p>The man touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed. \"Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin' for you.\"</p> <p>The dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. \"Look for someone else,\" he growled as he pulled his arm away.</p> <p>The man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. \"I'm sorry sir, but there ain't no one else. There's this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he's of Saint Ajax.\"</p> <p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away\u2014when someone else spoke.</p> <p>\"You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant,\" said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p> <p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who'd spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.</p> <p>\"John?\"</p> <p>The man turned to look up.</p> <p>\"Hi Vaant,\" he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middleaged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons. \"Folks,\" he said, \"this is Vaantikalisax, knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights.\"</p> <p>The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. \"What are you doing out here?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"These people need help. I said I'd find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.\"</p> <p>The draconian sniffed, released John's hand. \"Sure,\" he said. \"But why me?\"</p> <p>\"Thought maybe you'd like to get back in the game.\"</p> <p>\"The game.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\" Sir John smiled. \"The hero game.\"</p> <p>The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently.

Don't spoil it.\" He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.</p> <p>\"Vaant,\" Sir John said, following. \"Sir Vaantikalisax, by your oath!\" The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p> <p>\"The people need leadership,\" John said.</p> <p>Vaantikalisax's reptile eyes flashed in anger. \"They had it!

He looked at the nearby town that had adopted him. Peasants doing labor in the fields.</p> <p>He clenched his fist around the coin. \"A princely sum,\" he said, mostly to himself.</p> <p>\"You are Dazar,\" Embers dared. \"High theochron in exile.

Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.</p> <p>\"What if we're going in circles?\"</p> <p>\"Then we keep going in circles!\" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. \"Until we find the elves.\"</p> <p>\"The elves have found you!\" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p> <p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p> <p>Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.</p> <p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p> <p>\"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\" The voice they had heard called out again\u2014from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They wore a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p> <p>\"Consort!\" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \"We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.\"</p> <p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \"They called that one 'consort!'\"</p> <p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a See? I told you! look on their face.</p> <p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \"I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\" They indicated the elf who had spoken. \"This is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\"</p> <p>\"How did you know we were here?\" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p> <p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.</p> <p>\"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\" the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \"And approval,\" Rhythylthin added, clenching his fist and snapping the arrow in it.</p> <p>\"You come bearing a gift for our queen\u2014the Codex Dryadalis.\" Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \"My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\"</p> <p>The elf smiled at the children. \"But have no fear,\" they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a melody. \"You are safe \u2026 now.\" The pause before \"now\" spoke volumes.</p> <p>\"Are you a \u2026 a \u2026 boy or a girl?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander smiled gaily. \"I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\" they said. Wenna smiled.</p> <p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \"Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\" They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. \"Me? I'm old fashioned.\" They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \"Grace never goes out of style.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \"Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\" Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \"You may go.\"</p> <p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p> <p>\"How did they do that?\" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p> <p>\"Hmm? Do what?\" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p> <p>\"Just \u2026 disappear like that!\"</p> <p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \"Do terran children not play hiding games?\"</p> <p>\"Well \u2026\" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \"We do, but \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \"Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\"</p> <p>\"But that was \u2026\" Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. \"That was magic!\"</p> <p>\"You say? Well,\" Llyander mused, \"terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\" The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p> <p>Llyander turned and marched off. \"Come!\" they called. The children ran to catch up.</p> <p>\"Where are we going?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>\"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\" Llyander said. \"We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well\u2014likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.\" They smiled.</p> <p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.</p> <p>\"I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.\"</p> <p>The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.</p> <p>Jeremy turned to Dade. \"I feel like we're in a dream,\" he whispered. \"You are!\" their escort called out. \"The wode is a dream!

Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch.

You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. \"We feel very safe.\"</p> <p>\"Who are you kidding?\" Dade said. \"Everyone knows how much elves hate humans.\"</p> <p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p> <p>\"Show me an elf who hates humans,\" he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \"and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\" He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \"Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.\"</p> <p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.</p> <p>\"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it \u2026\"\u2014he looked at Llyander\u2014\"\u2026 by changing my mind.\"</p> <p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.</p> <p>\"Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught.\" Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. \"But this is not nothing,\" he said. \"We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my grandmother's grandmother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.\"</p> <p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. \"Well, you see children?\" Llyander said. \"We only have more to do, not everything to do.\"</p> <p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \"Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew on a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!\"</p> <p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p> <p>\"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.</p> <p>\"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my ancient relative labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\" He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p> <p>\"He seems wise,\" Credan said.</p> <p>\"And smart,\" Meliora said.</p> <p>\"I'm surprised how kind he is,\" Jeremy said. \"He seems a good king.\" Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually she couldn't resist. \"What?\"</p> <p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p> <p>\"Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?\" they said, their voice low. \"How astonished you were?\"</p> <p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \"This is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.\"</p> <p>\"But how do they do \u2026\"</p> <p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \"It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind.\"</p> <p>\"You mean they don't even know they're doing it?\" Meliora asked.</p> <p>\"Then what do they really look like?\" Wenna asked.</p> <p>Llyander shrugged. \"What does anyone really look like?\" And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.</p> <p>The king turned back to them. \"Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.\"</p> <p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. \"Not bad for your second quest.

And a giant stood before the lumbering egress.</p> <p>Dust settled on the ground behind the giant, and John realized the thunderclap was the sound of the giant running to them. Air that couldn't get out of the way fast enough, tortured by the pressure of his speed.</p> <p>The rectangular, toothed egress demon was twelve feet tall at least, the giant almost matching its immense size.</p> <p>In the instant before the maw of teeth and eyeballs shut, the giant grabbed each side of the mouth, and pulled. Muscles the size of hounds bulged. Tendons like ship cables stood taught, quivering with strain. \"Not today!\" the giant shouted. \"Not TODAY!!\"</p> <p>As the giant forced the maw open, glowing tentacles writhed out of it, wrapping around the giant's arms, legs, neck. \"Hahah!\" the figure laughed. \"You'll find \u2026 MY flesh \u2026\" the giant's bravado hid the fact that he was at the uttermost limits of his strength. \"\u2026 too RICH \u2026 for your taste!\"</p> <p>John knew what the giant did not\u2014the tendrils drained life, sapped energy.

A shout, and a thrust into the soulraker's back, and the demons surrounding Embers turned to face Sir John.</p> <p>He had to focus so intently on the demons who now surrounded him, he wasn't even sure Embers knew what to do.

The gamble, unspoken, was that the summoned demons would evaporate if their living portal were destroyed. It paid off.</p> <p>They only had a moment before the demons swarmed them, but a moment was all it took before the hakaan shouted and finally ripped the bloody egress demon apart with his bare hands.</p> <p>The demons in midstride all turned inside out, leaving bubbling, steaming pools of organs, eyeballs, and teeth on the ground. Leaving four heroes gasping from the fight.</p> <p>\"I told you \u2026\" Dazar said, hands on his knees. \"Not to open!

John wondered what she meant.</p> <p>\"From the beginning,\" the giant said enigmatically.</p> <p>\"Don't take this the wrong way,\" John confessed, \"but I was afraid we'd meet a barrow-man on this journey.\"</p> <p>The giant smiled \"Fear?

I did not understand why his path and yours seemed coincident, but now I think it has something to do with the thing they all seek, his demons.\"</p> <p>John looked at Embers. \"One of the Eleven Who Shall Not Be Named,\" she said. \"The fifth, I suspect. They were the elite deathless servants of the Lord of Swords who once ruled this land, many ages ago. Ajax is collecting the artifacts of ancient emperors.

I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students' names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p> <p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class. What do I think of humans?</p> <p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, for thirteen centuries. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p> <p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p> <p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Chaos 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p> <p>Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt \u2026 everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p> <p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short\u2014almost as soon as you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p> <p>That refusal to yield to death \u2026 to death \u2026 is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p> <p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last\u2014more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p> <p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but we learned of many great evils that plagued this world. We met the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, as he opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p> <p>We watched Cthrion Uroniziir try to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.1</p> <p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them\u2014all of them\u2014were led \u2026 by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.</p> <p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think \u2026 there must be.</p> <p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world \u2026 for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice \u2026 I can scarcely imagine.</p> <p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you\u2014normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p> <p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows.

I have to conclude you're a danger to the team and cut you loose.\"</p> <p>Revile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek's white porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it was brittle, fragile.</p> <p>Count Revile took a deep breath. \"We call it velloparatha,\" he said. \"In your tongue it would be \u2026 worldsick. Or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens \u2026 to my people \u2026 when they come to your world. It is an illness of \u2026 of feeling. Emotion.\"</p> <p>\"Are you going mad?\" John asked, his voice quiet. He wanted to give the count a chance to answer privately.</p> <p>The memonek smiled ruefully. \"It feels that way sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an insect that landed on my finger. A grasshopper the dwarf called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect and beautiful. That was awe.

It was at myself.\"</p> <p>\"At yourself ? Why? What did you \u2026?\"</p> <p>\"John,\" the memonek said, and now it was his turn to whisper. \"I was afraid. Afraid of \u2026 of being wounded, of failing you, failing my friends. Of dying. And out of that fear came \u2026 enormous anger. At myself. Anger that I was so weak so \u2026 useless.

She's three hundred years old. I've known her since I was fifteen. I don't think I've ever seen her blush.

He looked at Sir John. \"I didn't expect our friendship to be so short.\"</p> <p>John smiled and maybe blushed a little. \"Well,\" he said looking at the rest of the crew, \"being one of my friends these days is a hazardous profession.\"</p> <p>The count just got more serious. \"I was lucky to meet one such as you on this world.\"</p> <p>John shrugged. \"Only world I've ever known.\"</p> <p>Count Revile hefted the starcore. \"I have responsibilities to keep.

Just some knights, we can take care of them. But he has the Whitewater. Led by Bonebreaker Dorokor. That's three companies of elite light orc foot against a handful of peasant levies. We need the Howling.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps,\" Khorva said, and turned away from the crows to look out over the heroes. \"I know Dorokor, she is not like my brother. A head of meat and muscle. Dorokor is a thinker. You seek the Howling because you seek a counter to the Whitewater.\" She looked at John. \"But even better, talk to Dorokor. Deny Saxton his pet orc clan, and earn the allegiance of the Whitewater.\"</p> <p>\"Is such a thing possible?\" Embers asked.</p> <p>A moment passed. Khorva didn't break eye contact with John. \"It's possible,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The Howling or the Whitewater tribe,\" Dazar said. \"Either would be a formidable foe in any battle, such is the reputation of orcish warlore.\"</p> <p>Khorva shook her head. \"Orcs have no great love for battle. We love trees and green things. We love an unspoiled land. For this reason did Kul place us in the world. The last of the original speaking peoples.\"</p> <p>\"But also did Kul place the fire within you,\" Embers said.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Dazar added. \"You are not pacifists, you are warriors!\"</p> <p>\"We are pacifists,\" Khorva said with an emphasis that seemed almost a shout. Then a beat of silence and a smile played across her lips. \"And we are warriors.\"</p> <p>\"We're not here to make a deal,\" John said. \"We're not for sale and neither are you. This is about righting a wrong. It's about helping people.\" He paused and something unrehearsed, unbidden came from his lips.</p> <p>\"It's about living with yourself. Sleeping at night.\"</p> <p>\"Battles do not bring restful sleep,\" Khorva said. \"The opposite, I find.\" \"Battles bring glory! Battles make heroes!\" Dazar insisted, and John</p> <p>felt like he learned something about the dwarf in that moment. He could hear that Dazar believed this to be true, and knew it was a lie. It was a test.</p> <p>\"War makes only one thing. Corpses.\" Khorva looked down at the high theochron, who nodded. Test passed.</p> <p>\"And veterans,\" Sir John said. \"Who covet peace.\" Khorva nodded. Respect. \"Aye,\" she said.

Well, Jackson Bootblack seemed to be doing most of the talking.</p> <p>\"This kind of shit doesn't work if it's just a bunch of ratcatchers like us,\" the polder said. \"You need the people to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died\u2014fifteen years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know? They adapt.\"</p> <p>\"If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie flat,\" A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers said. \"But what do you say?\"</p> <p>\"Eh?\" the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John staring at him. \"You say the people have no stomach for rebellion,\" Embers said. \"But what about you?\"</p> <p>\"Oh,\" the polder said, \"I say it doesn't matter much what I say. Why's he looking at me like that?\" he asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. \"Sorry, I just \u2026 I never met a polder before,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Are you kidding me?\" Jackson said.</p> <p>\"No! Sorry, I just \u2026\"</p> <p>\"What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you never met a polder before? There's polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea.\"</p> <p>\"Really? That's weird.

She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other. \"John's just never run into one, it seems.\"</p> <p>\"Well, we're adorable,\" the polder said, and drank some ale. \"They must have been around I guess,\" John said. \"I probably just never noticed.\"</p> <p>The polder put his drink down. \"Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it's funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much noise as a cow, which \u2026 I don't even know how you manage that.\"</p> <p>\"You're talking just \u2026 my voice is just as loud as yours!\"</p> <p>\"I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move, the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn noise.\"</p> <p>Jago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.</p> <p>\"Humans are loud, yes,\" Embers agreed.</p> <p>\"Do we have to \u2026 can we talk about something else, please?\" John said.</p> <p>\"I just \u2026\" The polder wouldn't let it go. \"You seriously never \u2026 you never been to an inn? Cavall's teeth, I can't count how many inns and taverns I've been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we're good at, I think.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah?\" John asked. \"What's the other one?\"</p> <p>The little man smiled. \"Getting into places we ain't supposed to be.\" \"Now we're talking,\" Sir John said. \"You were saying we need the people behind us. I agree.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.\" The polder took the question seriously. \"It's not hard. First, we need someone they'll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that's all. I'll take care of the rest.\"</p> <p>\"I'm working on that,\" John said. \"But it's \u2026 slower going than I thought. I'm betting on a long shot.\"</p> <p>\"What's the holdup?\"</p> <p>John thought about how to put what he knew into words. \"You know \u2026\" He shrugged. \"Some people can only be heroes if they think they're better than everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they're not. And some people \u2026\"</p> <p>He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table, and now he was mostly talking to himself. \"Some people still have to figure that out.\"</p> <p>\"Which is best?\" Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.</p> <p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. \"Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero,\" he said.</p> <p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed. \"Okay. Well, if you've already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: We need a good story\u2014short, punchy.

Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\"</p> <p>\"Where are we going to find three ogres?\" John asked.</p> <p>\"What do you mean?\" Now it was the polder's turn to be confused. \"What do you mean, 'What do I mean?'\" John said.</p> <p>\"I'm not \u2026 we don't need real ogres.\" Jackson looked at the elf. \"Is he for real?\"</p> <p>\"Trust me,\" the void mage said.</p> <p>\"You mean you're going to make it up?!\" John exclaimed.</p> <p>\"I \u2026\" Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \"Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?\" he asked the elf.</p> <p>\"He'll learn.\" Embers smiled.</p> <p>The polder turned back to Sir John. \"Hello. I lie for a living. And I'm really good at it. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn't work.\"</p> <p>John turned to Embers. \"I thought he was a thief.\"</p> <p>\"I was a thief,\" the polder said.</p> <p>\"You were a thief.\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am\u2014they don't exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.\"</p> <p>\"Did they kick you out, or did you quit?\"</p> <p>\"Depends on who you ask. I don't like being told what to do. It's sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.\"</p> <p>\"So what are you now?\"</p> <p>\"I'm annoying.\"</p> <p>The elf smiled. \"He's a troubadour\u2014one of the best.\"</p> <p>Sir John looked at him, nodded. \"No lute, I notice. And you don't seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.\"</p> <p>The polder grinned. \"I ain't that kind of troubadour. I'm the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\"</p> <p>\"Propaganda,\" Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p> <p>\"Hey,\" the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \"Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.\"</p> <p>John turned to see.</p> <p>Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.</p> <p>\"I, uh \u2026\" Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants.

Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of castoff scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.\"</p> <p>The taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blond.</p> <p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. \"Where is your worldship?\" he said in a more reasonable voice. \"Or came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?\" At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise. \"You see?\" the taxiarch said, impressed with himself. \"I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien.\" He nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. \"I am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.\" Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. \"If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.\"</p> <p>The alien sighed. \"'Blaap blaap blaap,'\" she said. \"You should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble.\" She nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p> <p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p> <p>\"Look how easily this one is goaded!\" she said. She spat out dark-blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \"You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these \u2026 bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps from the air,\" Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \"I could scout the forest around the \u2026\"</p> <p>\"No!\" Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the Hawklord and strode toward her. \"You are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one \u2026\" he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \"\u2026 will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\" He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p> <p>\"They may pull you apart,\" he said to her, and at this his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p> <p>\"Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\" At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p> <p>\"Shall I let you choose?\" the taxiarch said, and drew a dagger from his belt. \"I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then \u2026\"</p> <p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p> <p>\"\u2026 should be ready for anything,\" one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the Hawklord, and the taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p> <p>\"Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\" another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and seven heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A dwarf with his battle-staff tipped with an hourglass. An orc with a huge battleaxe casually resting on her shoulder. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. An unarmed hakaan towering over everyone. And a dragon knight. Of all the motley band, it was the dragon knight who caused the people of the town to gasp. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.</p> <p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the taxiarch bellowed \"Hold fast!\" and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them against the certain fear of their commander.</p> <p>The hakaan looked around and saw a clump of villagers watching the scene from a distance, gathered around what looked like some stables. He waved. \"Hello!\" he said, smiling.</p> <p>One of the villagers waved back before being shushed.</p> <p>John looked at the taxiarch and immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p> <p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty\u2014reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional\u2014could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p> <p>Not the war dogs\u2014they were fanatics.</p> <p>\"What's this?\" the taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \"Allies of the alien?\" He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p> <p>\"Allies of all those who suffer, and seek justice,\" the dwarf announced. Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \"Embers?\"</p> <p>\"A kuran'zoi,\" the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \"A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\"</p> <p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers explicitly.</p> <p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out. All he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p> <p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the taxiarch didn't react. That spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p> <p>\"She goes free,\" John commanded, his voice steel, \"or you die here.\" He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p> <p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p> <p>\"I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these \u2026 creatures?\" The war dog taxiarch looked at the elf, giant, polder, dwarf, and dragon knight. \"Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you \u2026\"\u2014his voice lowered almost to a whisper\u2014\"\u2026 to be on the winning side for a change.\"</p> <p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p> <p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p> <p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p> <p>John felt his skin tighten as Dazar warded him, and from the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one saw him move from where he'd been a moment before.</p> <p>The hakaan burst into action and sped past him like a blur.</p> <p>At the same instant, a call\u2014a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in his heart\u2014the clarion call of the last Storm Knight!</p> <p>At the sound, the orc dashed forward into a knot of wardog commandos, her axe already hewing about her.</p> <p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword and falchion. \"All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\" He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the shortsword on his belt.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#time-raider-traits","title":"Time Raider Traits","text":"<p>Time raider heroes have access to the following traits.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Ancestries/#signature-trait-psychic-scar","title":"Signature Trait: Psychic Scar","text":"<p>Your mind is a formidable layer of defense.

About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p> <p>That covers a lot! So let's get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.</p> <p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn't a dungeon crawler. It's not about \"clearing rooms.\" It's not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like Shadowdark.</p> <p>It's not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It's not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p> <p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like Forbidden Lands.</p> <p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like Call of Cthulhu. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn't a comedy RPG like Paranoia.</p> <p>Draw Steel is definitely a game about creating amazing stories in which the heroes fight monsters and villains using strategy and tactics. Draw Steel has a lot of other tools! But fighting monsters is sort of non-negotiable. If you're looking for a game featuring extraordinary heroes overcoming dramatic villains without the focus on tactical combat, maybe check out Daggerheart! Just right next door alphabet-wise!</p> <p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.</p> <p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That's its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p> <p>But \"heroic fantasy\" is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: tactical and cinematic.</p> <p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. \"Both of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?\"</p> <p>So let's talk about what we mean when we use these terms.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#tactical","title":"Tactical","text":"<p>Strategy is: \"What are we trying to do?\" Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p> <p>Tactics is about: \"How are we going to do that?\" We're going to \u2026 surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! \"No resurrections!\"</p> <p>In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means all players are focused on the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We're all aware of what's happening, and we can talk about what we're going to do to stop it.</p> <p>That means teamwork matters. That's why the order of combat works the way it does\u2014to encourage the players to plan! \"Okay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it'll push him back, and on my turn, I can use Squad! Forward! to get us all into melee with the death captain.\" We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic!</p> <p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each combat round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don't feel as if you outlasted your opponents because you wore their Stamina down before they could reduce yours to 0\u2014you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!</p> <p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, \"combos.\" Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and to rely on them to do their cool things. It's a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p> <p>You learn which characters are the \"squishies\" who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. \"Don't worry about healing Barlaca. She's our fury. She's happier with 3 Stamina.\" Our game is not about tactics. It's not a wargame. But it is tactical.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#heroic","title":"Heroic","text":"<p>Our game is definitely about heroism! For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don't assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don't assume that. Instead we assume you're going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that's part of the fun!</p> <p>You should absolutely be able to run a Chain of Acheron-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that's not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.</p> <p>So that's one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen \"onscreen,\" so to speak. This is closely related to the cinematic keyword.</p> <p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.</p> <p>These things do happen. No one watching Raiders of the Lost Ark thinks that Indy's gun is magic and doesn't need bullets\u2014but we simply don't need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don't need to waste time on it.</p> <p>Likewise in our game, we don't worry about stuff that heroes in fiction tend not to worry about. We don't worry how much everything you're carrying weighs. If you try to lift a bear, you might have trouble, sure. But nowhere on your character sheet are you tracking the weight of every item.</p> <p>You don't track food such as rations, and you don't worry about how many torches you have. Light might factor into a specific environment, because that can be a fun tactical challenge, but the game doesn't expect that everyone is always worried about running out of light.</p> <p>Basically, we worry only about those things you'd see your characters doing in a movie, or a comic, or a novel about their adventures. Assume all the tedious stuff happens off-screen. Speaking of things happening on-screen \u2026</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#cinematic","title":"Cinematic","text":"<p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like abilities and features to be strongly evocative. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. \"In All This Confusion\" is a good name for the shadow's ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates an awareness that explains how it's working.</p> <p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you experience that action in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn't feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p> <p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free strikes, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That's what the name implies. And if we've done a good job, when you read through your character's abilities, you think, \"Yes! This is what I was imagining! I can't wait to do this!\"</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#fantasy","title":"Fantasy","text":"<p>Just \u2026 you know \u2026 it's got dragons and stuff.</p> <p>It's worth mentioning\u2014while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we're developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City in This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.</p> <p>Looking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that '70s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There's nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!</p> <p>So our setting includes the timescape\u2014our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly \"space fantasy.\"</p> <p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.</p> <p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style!</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy","title":"If You're Coming From D20 Fantasy","text":"<p>We know that many folks are coming to this game having only experienced d20 fantasy RPGs. This section details a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you'll notice right away. These aren't the only distinctions, but they're the most obvious.</p> <ul> <li>Character options are different. We strongly recommend you start exploring Draw Steel by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can't just assume the conduit is \"basically a cleric.\" In some ways, it is! But in other ways, it's quite different. You might have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 fantasy, and you're dying to see how that might work in Draw Steel. But you'll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Classes sections and getting inspired. Once you know a bit more about how the game works, you'll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character the Draw Steel way.</li> <li>Smaller bonuses and penalties. Draw Steel is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes\u2014tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes\u2014success or failure. But we've run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of \u22122 is significant in Draw Steel, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls\u2014the rolls you make to determine success both in and out of combat\u2014if you have a decent characteristic bonus to add to those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you'll do even better.</li> <li>Abilities automatically deal damage. When you use an ability\u2014one of the unique combat features that defines your character\u2014you can still have a bad turn! A tier 1 outcome with minimal damage and effects is the worst outcome you can obtain with an ability. It's not awesome. But you're still always making progress. The question is: Who's making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there's no, \"I miss, who's next?\" in this game, fights typically last 3 or fewer rounds. A fight that lasts 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone's always doing damage!</li> <li>You don't need to rest all the time. Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries\u2014the stats that determine how robust you are in combat. But all characters earn the capability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li> <li>Our game has a lot of skills. Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don't expect you to memorize that list. We get into why the Tests chapter features so many skills, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in Draw Steel. And skills in the game aren't tied to characteristics. If you're trying to lose someone in a crowd, you can use Presence\u2014the characteristic that represents your character's force of personality\u2014to try to hide! Why not?</li> <li>We won't be able to point out every difference. Beyond what's noted here, don't assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you've played. We don't have the space to point out every exception. So if you're in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you'll find that things make better sense. If you're still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We've got tons of awesome community members ready to help!</li> <li>We don't expect you to do everything to the letter. This is actually one thing Draw Steel does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don't stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/Introduction/#glossary-index","title":"GLOSSARY INDEX","text":"<p>The following rules and game terms are fully defined and expanded upon in this book.

This often takes the form of a campaign pitch the Director presents to the players.</li> <li>The Director should tell the players if any options are limited or rare in their campaign. For example, some Directors don't want psionics to appear in their game worlds, so they might decide that heroes can't be nulls or talents. Another campaign might be grounded in more typical medieval fantasy and not have any memonek or time raiders, or those ancestries might be exceedingly rare. In the latter case, players should know that their memonek or time raider heroes are likely to get a lot of questions from curious NPCs.</li> <li>The players get a chance to tell the Director what they would like to experience in the campaign. This can include anything from \"I'd love to play out some chase scenes!\" to \"I want to explore themes of loss and grief.\" These wishes should be starting points for a conversation.

Larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.</p> <p>It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic where flying tapestries act as taxis, the reality of living in Capital is somewhat more mundane. Only the very wealthy can afford such luxuries.</p> <p>The great houses, ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think vast wealth entitles them to rule. The great houses are very proud of their city. They believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, expect justice. They just don't think anyone else should be able to rule.</p> <p>The guilds, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, and largely obsessed with accruing wealth, city be damned. Three of them recently used their obscene wealth to buy great house status and now play the great game with the best of them.</p> <p>The \"great game\" is espionage, and House Alvaro are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsor the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. While the greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the colleges in the university, which has historically doubled as the prince's intelligence agency.</p> <p>House Vorona run the city's navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy's cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona's Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing Capital has to a city-wide law enforcement organization. Each great house is expected to police its own district.</p> <p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring that gives Vorona access to intelligence other factions can only dream of.</p> <p>House Navarr, oldest of the great houses, enforces the church's law, which they call justice. Led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of the most powerful church in the city\u2014the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless\u2014House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and orders of knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.</p> <p>Arguably the most powerful great house, House Valetta controls the Arbitros Fiat, the tax collectors. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore who, in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, opened the Codex Mortis and spoke the ritual which should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed every mortal in her district, including herself, into deathless revenants. Now, the Duchess Lenore is an immortal vampire queen. A dead lady, ruling over a dead city.</p> <p>After the Lilac Night, when the prince was no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes they collected, Lady Shirome</p> <p>coordinated with two other guilds to buy Great House status for themselves.</p> <p>Lady Shirome runs the city's assayers guild, the Fulcrum. The guild controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was the Fulcrum that convinced the prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p> <p>The Broadsheets, formally known as the Font, publish the thrice-daily news sheets everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster In\u0101n al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in the city.</p> <p>The Farrier's Guild, popularly known as the Rasp, control transport throughout the city. Led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from Alloy who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the 13-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He created the Kites, couriers famous for getting a message anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. Kashimir's monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives him enormous power, and he is not shy about seeking more.</p> <p>Three years ago, the prince of Capital died leaving no heir or even a likely candidate. He was a young man, only forty-one, but the events surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and inaccurate accounts. Was he murdered like a commoner, or assassinated by a political rival? Evidence is scant, rumor substitutes as fact.</p> <p>Now the great game takes on a new meaning as the four great houses and three newly ascendant guilds jockey for position, each wanting to step into the power vacuum left by the dead prince. Everyone knows a war is coming, a war of succession that means fighting on the street.

People travelling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible law of UNISOL.</p> <p>Traveling downward from Quintessence one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. Technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind or the miracle mineral iridoss, also known as prismacore.</p> <p>Almost coterminal with Orden is its sister-manifold, the World Below, the Dark Under All, a plane of exiles ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star's Silver, the Queen of Night, first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves, and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, only endless caverns and warrens, some vast enough to hold entire cities, like Or-Mazaar City of the Black Star from which the Queen of Night rules.</p> <p>The power of the World Below wanes, while the power of Equinox waxes. A smaller, parasitic manifold home to the twilight celestials and their servants the shadow elves, Equinox is ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below who plots to bridge the sea between worlds and colonize Orden making a new home for her people before their old world dies. A fierce, fairy-tale, weird magic, jungle world of permanent twilight also known as Dusk.</p> <p>The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell is among the lowest of the lower planes. A land of devils proud of their civilization, each of the seven cities is ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. A world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more interesting down here.</p> <p>The seven archdevils conspired together once; agreeing to create the Order of Desolation\u2014also known as the Illriggers\u2014to extend their power into the timescape, and defend Hell from the horde of demons below.</p> <p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience and gain identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upwards, out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identity, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.</p> <p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City, a city of the dead, ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the Heliopolis.</p>"},{"location":"Rules/Chapters/The%20Basics/#setting-design","title":"Setting Design","text":"<p>Orden and the timescape were both designed over the last 25 years to be an explicitly commercial setting. A product where you could find all the things everyone expects to find in a classic fantasy setting, with new takes on classic tropes and a little more \"Why are things like this?\" work done to ground everything and make things feel plausible. None of this makes Orden \"better\" than other settings, it just gives it character.</p> <p>Orden is not explicitly a high fantasy world, even though there are some pretty high fantasy things going on in it, because the average person has very little access to magic. The typical village might have a priest who knows some real prayers that close wounds or cure minor ailments, or an alchemist or hedge wizard who can brew some potions or conjure minor spells, but that's the extent of it. The result is, though Orden is a pre-industrial world with technology and societies akin to 13th-century Europe, the quality of life of the people who live there is a lot closer to ours. They live about as long as we do, die from disease about as often as we do, and generally have diets similar to ours, though with vastly more basic and constricted options on their menus.</p> <p>In Capital, for instance, people use flying tapestries to get around the city quickly, but these are a luxury available only to the rich. The vast majority of Capital's citizens live a life basically the same as your average Londoner in Shakespeare's time. Less plague and fire, though.</p> <p>It's not clear to us, looking in, but it doesn't seem as though Orden operates according to the real-world laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. People in the middle ages here on Earth didn't know about quarks or DNA, but they still knew everything was made of \"stuff\" and everyone expected a child to more or less resemble their parents. Essentially, Orden works the way people living in any culture's medieval era believed the real world actually worked. Because of the presence of magic, prayer, and psionics in the world, it's unlikely anything like science or an industrial age will ever come to Orden.</p> <p>Ultimately, while there are 10th-level characters out there, these are exceedingly rare. Most people in Orden do not have class levels. Only a few are 1st level anything! No one has ever tried to take a census of all the censors, conduits, furies, and so forth, but if they did, they'd probably end up with a chart that looks a lot like Zipf's Law.</p> <p>Finally, most information about Orden and the timescape is presented from the point of view of someone living in Orden. They can tell you what they think they know, but even learned historians do not agree, and new information constantly comes to light challenging the accepted academic wisdom. Just like \u2026 you get it.</p> <p>This lack of objective certainty not only makes it more fun for us to work on Orden, it makes it easier for you to make Orden yours. This comes at the price of certainty. (Are the Dragon Phalanx really \"incorruptible?\" Well, a lot of people still say that! In spite of concrete evidence to the contrary!) But we think it helps relieve some of the anxiety Directors have when they want to run a game in Orden but are afraid they don't know \"enough\" or \"everything.\" Not to worry. No one knows everything!</p> <p>P.S. We use the phrase \"Orden and the timescape\" because Orden is, as it were, the star of the show. But Orden is very clearly only one world in the timescape. It's like those astronomy maps hanging on the wall in your grade school science class that said, \"Earth and the solar system.\" Like that map, any map of the timescape will be an artist's interpretation, not drawn to scale, and never wholly accurate depending on what information you're looking for.</p> <p>The Timescape in Your Game</p> <p>We use the timescape and its medieval fantasyland Orden as the default setting presented in these books. Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy world. We also think it's easier for you to take the names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them with your own. We might reference some hero or villain, saint or god, whose name makes you think, \"Well, I don't have that in my setting.\" If we do a good job, though, you might be inspired to say, \"But that makes me think \u2026\" And being inspired is part of the fun!</p> <p>If you're the Director, you can use as many or as few of the details of the timescape as you like. You might wish to create your own world within the timescape, or use a setting you've created that exists outside of the official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from settings published by other companies. There are no rules when it comes to worldbuilding. Feel free to take what you like from this book and change the rest. For example, you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone skin. That's fine. You can make them fleshy, stout, bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers, or anything else you wish. As long as you're running a heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the game's rules are still likely to serve your narrative even if that narrative deviates from ours.</p> <p>If you're a player, ask your Director about the setting where the game takes place and discuss with them the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest discussion with your Director can lead to everyone getting what they want out of the game.</p> <p>What's Next?
