<h2 id="what-is-this-game">What is This Game?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-this-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is a game about fighting monsters. About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.</p>
<p>That covers a lot! So let's get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.</p>
<p>This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn't a dungeon crawler. It's not about "clearing rooms." It's not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.</p>
<p>You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not <em>about</em> dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/ShadowDark">Shadowdark</a></em>.</p>
<p>It's not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It's not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.</p>
<p>You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/ForbiddenLands">Forbidden Lands</a></em>.</p>
<p>You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn't a comedy RPG like <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Draw Steel</em> is definitely a game about creating amazing stories in which the heroes fight monsters and villains using strategy and tactics. <em>Draw Steel</em> has a lot of other tools! But fighting monsters is sort of non-negotiable. If you're looking for a game featuring extraordinary heroes overcoming dramatic villains without the focus on tactical combat, maybe check out <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/DaggerHeart">Daggerheart</a></em>! Just right next door alphabet-wise!</p>
<p>We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.</p>
<p>Our game is heroic fantasy. That's its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.</p>
<p>But "heroic fantasy" is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: tactical and cinematic.</p>
<p>These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. "Both of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?"</p>
<p>So let's talk about what we mean when we use these terms.</p>
<h3 id="tactical">Tactical<a class="headerlink" href="#tactical" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Strategy is: "What are we trying to do?" Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.</p>
<p>Tactics is about: "How are we going to do that?" We're going to … surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! "No resurrections!"</p>
<p>In a tactical game, <em>positioning matters</em>. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means all players are focused on the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We're all aware of what's happening, and we can talk about what we're going to do to stop it.</p>
<p>That means <em>teamwork matters</em>. That's why the order of combat works the way it does—to encourage the players to plan! "Okay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it'll push him back, and on my turn, I can use Squad! Forward! to get us all into melee with the death captain." We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic!</p>
<p>In a tactical game, you have many choices each combat round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don't feel as if you outlasted your opponents because you wore their Stamina down before they could reduce yours to 0—you feel like you <em>beat</em> those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!</p>
<p>As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, "combos." Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and to rely on them to do their cool things. It's a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.</p>
<p>You learn which characters are the "squishies" who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. "Don't worry about healing Barlaca. She's our fury. She's happier with 3 Stamina." Our game is not <em>about</em> tactics. It's not a wargame. But it is tactical.</p>
<h3 id="heroic">Heroic<a class="headerlink" href="#heroic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Our game is <em>definitely</em> about heroism! For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don't assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don't <em>assume</em> that. Instead we assume you're going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that's part of the fun!</p>
<p>You should absolutely be able to run a <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/TheChainPlaylist">Chain of Acheron</a></em>-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that's not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.</p>
<p>So that's one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen "onscreen," so to speak. This is closely related to the cinematic keyword.</p>
<p>For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.</p>
<p>These things do happen. No one watching <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> thinks that Indy's gun is magic and doesn't need bullets—but we simply don't need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don't need to waste time on it.</p>
<p>Likewise in our game, we don't worry about stuff that heroes in fiction tend not to worry about. We don't worry how much everything you're carrying weighs. If you try to lift a bear, you might have trouble, sure. But nowhere on your character sheet are you tracking the weight of every item.</p>
<p>You don't track food such as rations, and you don't worry about how many torches you have. Light might factor into a specific environment, because that can be a fun tactical challenge, but the game doesn't expect that everyone is always worried about running out of light.</p>
<p>Basically, we worry only about those things you'd see your characters doing in a movie, or a comic, or a novel about their adventures. Assume all the tedious stuff happens off-screen. Speaking of things happening on-screen …</p>
<h3 id="cinematic">Cinematic<a class="headerlink" href="#cinematic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like abilities and features to be strongly evocative. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. "In All This Confusion" is a good name for the shadow's ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates an awareness that explains <em>how</em> it's working.</p>
<p>When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you <em>experience</em> that action in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn't feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.</p>
<p>You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free strikes, extra maneuvers. <em>Coordinating</em> the battle. That's what the name implies. And if we've done a good job, when you read through your character's abilities, you think, "Yes! This is what I was imagining! I can't wait to do this!"</p>
<h3 id="fantasy">Fantasy<a class="headerlink" href="#fantasy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Just … you know … it's got dragons and stuff.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning—while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we're developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City in This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, <em>hundreds</em> of different ancestries in it.</p>
<p>Looking back at movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that '70s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There's nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!</p>
<p>So our setting includes the timescape—our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly "space fantasy."</p>
<p>These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.</p>
<p>For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style!</p>
<h3 id="if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy">If You're Coming From D20 Fantasy<a class="headerlink" href="#if-youre-coming-from-d20-fantasy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We know that many folks are coming to this game having only experienced d20 fantasy RPGs. This section details a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you'll notice right away. These aren't the only distinctions, but they're the most obvious.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character options are different.</strong> We strongly recommend you start exploring <em>Draw Steel</em> by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can't just assume the conduit is "basically a cleric." In some ways, it is! But in other ways, it's quite different. You might have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 fantasy, and you're dying to see how that might work in <em>Draw Steel</em>. But you'll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Classes sections and getting inspired. Once you know a bit more about how the game works, you'll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character the <em>Draw Steel</em> way.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller bonuses and penalties.</strong> <em>Draw Steel</em> is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes—tier 1, tier 2, or tier 3. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes—success or failure. But we've run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of −2 is significant in <em>Draw Steel</em>, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls—the rolls you make to determine success both in and out of combat—if you have a decent characteristic bonus to add to those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you'll do even better.</li>
<li><strong>Abilities automatically deal damage.</strong> When you use an ability—one of the unique combat features that defines your character—you can still have a bad turn! A tier 1 outcome with minimal damage and effects is the worst outcome you can obtain with an ability. It's not awesome. But you're still always making progress. The question is: Who's making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there's no, "I miss, who's next?" in this game, fights typically last 3 or fewer rounds. A fight that lasts 5 rounds is a <em>long</em> fight. Because everyone's always doing damage!</li>
<li><strong>You don't need to rest all the time.</strong> Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In <em>Draw Steel</em>, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries—the stats that determine how robust you are in combat. But all characters earn the capability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.</li>
<li><strong>Our game has a lot of skills.</strong> Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don't expect you to memorize that list. We get into why the Tests chapter features so many skills, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in <em>Draw Steel</em>. And skills in the game aren't tied to characteristics. If you're trying to lose someone in a crowd, you can use Presence—the characteristic that represents your character's force of personality—to try to hide! Why not?</li>
<li><strong>We won't be able to point out every difference.</strong> Beyond what's noted here, don't assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you've played. We don't have the space to point out every exception. So if you're in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you'll find that things make better sense. If you're still confused, stop by the <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/Discord">MCDM Discord</a></em> and ask. We've got tons of awesome community members ready to help!</li>
<li><strong>We don't expect you to do everything to the letter.</strong> This is actually one thing <em>Draw Steel</em> does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don't stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right.</li>

<p><strong>Combat Round:</strong> A segment of a combat encounter in which each creature participating in the battle takes a turn.</p>
<p><strong>Complication:</strong> A dramatic narrative twist that deepens a hero's backstory and gives them a rules benefit and drawback. Complications are an optional rule.</p>
<p><strong>Concealment:</strong> A state where a target has their form entirely covered in a concealing effect that doesn't block line of effect, such as darkness or fog. While a target has concealment, strikes used against them take a bane.</p>
<p><strong>Condition:</strong> A negative effect that applies to a creature and uses a universal shorthand name. Bleeding, dazed, frightened, grabbed, prone, restrained, slowed, taunted, and weakened are conditions in <em>Draw Steel</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Conduit:</strong> A class for a hero who is the devoted spellcasting priest of a saint or god.</p>

<p><strong>Creature:</strong> Living and unliving beings, including constructs and undead.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Hit:</strong> When a creature rolls a natural 19 or 20 on an ability roll made as part of a main action, that creature gains an additional main action that they can use immediately. An ability roll made as part of a maneuver can't score a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong>Cube:</strong> When an ability or other effect creates a cube, that area is expressed as "X cube." The number X is the length of each of the area's sides. A cube effect might last only as long as it takes to affect its targets, or it might have a duration specified by the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Culture:</strong> The community in which a hero was raised.</p>
<p><strong>d3:</strong> A three-sided die, often rolled using a d6.</p>

<h1 id="the-basics">The Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The flow of playing <em>Draw Steel</em> is like playing any other tabletop roleplaying game with a Director (also called a Game Master or GM in other games). Play is a conversation between the Director and the heroes that describes the story. The Director sets the scene, describing the important elements of the environment that the heroes would notice.</p>
<p><strong>Director (Willy):</strong> <em>You stand in the doorway of the top level of the ruined necromancer's tower. The air is stale and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks, beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.</em></p>
<p>After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how their character interacts with the area. The Director then describes how the environment and any creatures in it respond to the heroes' actions.</p>
<p><strong>Alyssa (playing Jorn, a tactician):</strong> <em>I'm going to hang out at the back of the group with my warhammer drawn. I want to be ready in case any of those skeletons we snuck by on the lower levels make their way up the stairs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt (playing Linn, a talent):</strong> <em>Linn uses her Minor Telekinesis ability to sweep up the glass on the floor and form a path free of glass that goes from the door to the dais.</em></p>
<p><strong>James (playing Korvo, a shadow):</strong> <em>I'll light a torch as I step into the room. Is there anything new we can see now?</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>With the glass cleared away and brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor is covered in faded sigils.</em></p>
<p>At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively interesting. In such cases, the Director calls for some dice to be rolled! Don't worry—the rules outline when and how to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Grace (playing Val, a conduit):</strong> <em>Before anyone steps on them, I want to examine the symbols and figure out what they mean.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>Okay, well for that, I need you to make an easy Reason test.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> <em>I got a 12! What do I know?</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>You can tell these old sigils are part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It's the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.</em></p>
<p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> <em>Uh, let's make a decision here, folks. We got boneheads incoming!</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> <em>Linn has had enough of this dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside the room so we can shut and barricade the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> <em>Uh-oh.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>Before anyone else can move, Linn's foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> <em>Oh, right. Necromancy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace:</strong> <em>Yeah. Should have warned you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>The whole tower starts to sway as the sarcophagus lids crash to the floor and clawed undead hands emerge from within. Six decaying devils, each tattooed with glowing green runes, rise. They're eager for violence.</em></p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> <em>I think we found the Rotting Lords of Hell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> <em>Draw steel!</em></p>
<p>When combat starts, it's time to use a square-gridded map and miniatures to represent the position of the heroes relative to their enemies and the environment. The rules become a little more granular during combat to keep things interesting and fair, but the idea that the game is a conversation between the Director and the other players remains the same.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each creature in the game has five characteristics that represent their physical and mental prowess.</p>
<h4 id="might">Might<a class="headerlink" href="#might" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Might (represented by M in abilities and other features) represents strength and brawn. A creature's capability to break down doors, swing an axe, stand up during an earthquake, or hurl an ally across a chasm is determined by Might.</p>
<h4 id="agility">Agility<a class="headerlink" href="#agility" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Agility (A) represents coordination and nimbleness. A creature's capacity to backflip out of danger, shoot a crossbow, dodge an explosion, or pluck keys from a guard's belt is determined by Agility.</p>
<h4 id="reason">Reason<a class="headerlink" href="#reason" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Reason (R) represents a logical mind and education. A creature's capacity to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door, recall lore about necromancy, decipher a coded message, or blast a foe with psionic power is determined by Reason.</p>
<h4 id="intuition">Intuition<a class="headerlink" href="#intuition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Intuition (I) represents instincts and experience. A creature's capability to recognize a faint sound as the approach of a distant rider, quickly read the tell of a bluffing gambler, calm a rearing horse, or track a monster across the tundra is determined by Intuition.</p>
<h4 id="presence">Presence<a class="headerlink" href="#presence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Presence (P) represents force of personality. A creature's capacity to lie to a judge, convince a crowd to join a revolution, impress a queen at a royal banquet, or cast a magic spell by singing a song is determined by Presence.</p>
<h4 id="characteristic-scores">Characteristic Scores<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristic-scores" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each characteristic has a score that runs from −5 to +5. The higher a score, the more impact a creature has with that characteristic. A baby bunny rabbit would have a Might score of −5, while an ancient dragon would have a Might score of 5. The average human has a score of 0 in all their characteristics. Characteristic scores are added to power rolls—the dice rolls you make whenever your character attempts a task with an uncertain outcome (see <a href="#page-18-0">Power Rolls</a> below).</p>
<h3 id="dice">Dice<a class="headerlink" href="#dice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This game uses ten-sided dice (also called d10s). Each player (including the Director) should have two of these. Some ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9 while others are numbered 1 to 10. In the case of the former, a 0 counts as 10.</p>
<p>The game also makes occasional use of six-sided dice (called d6s), so it's helpful if each player has one or two of those as well.</p>
<h4 id="d3s">D3s<a class="headerlink" href="#d3s" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>On rare occasions, the rules ask a player to roll one or more three-sided dice (also called d3s). If you don't have a d3, you can roll a six-sided die instead, treating a roll of 1–2 as a 1, a roll of 3–4 as a 2, and a roll of 5–6 as a 3.</p>
<h4 id="d100s">D100s<a class="headerlink" href="#d100s" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some tables in the game call for a d100 roll. To roll a d100, grab two ten-sided dice. Decide which die represents the tens digit, with the other die representing the ones digit. For instance, if you roll a 5 for the tens digit and a 3 for the ones digit, the number rolled is 53.</p>
<p>Some ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9, while others are numbered 1 to 10. For the latter type of dice, a 10 counts as a 0 for the purpose of rolling a d100. For instance, if a 10 is rolled for the tens digit and a 9 is rolled for the ones digit, the number rolled is 09, or 9.</p>
<p>If both dice rolled show a 0 or 10, then the number rolled is 100!</p>
<h3 id="power-rolls">Power Rolls<a class="headerlink" href="#power-rolls" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Whenever a hero or other creature in the game attempts a task with an uncertain outcome, such as attacking a foe, sneaking by a guard patrol without being seen, or persuading a queen to provide military aid, the creature makes a power roll to determine the outcome of their actions.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-power-rolls">Types of Power Rolls<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-power-rolls" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The game uses two types of power rolls. An <strong>ability roll</strong> is used when you use certain abilities to determine their impact. For instance, if a fury uses their Brutal Slam ability to strike an enemy, their ability roll determines how much damage the enemy takes and how far back the enemy is pushed. See <a href="#page-83-0">Abilities</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A <strong>test</strong> is a power roll you make outside of using your abilities to affect or interact with the world around you. A tactician might not have an ability that lets them climb up the face of a cliff, so climbing is an activity they can attempt with a test. An elementalist doesn't have an ability that lets them automatically intimidate a cultist into backing down from a fight, but they can make a test if they want to try. See <a href="#page-263-0">Tests</a> for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sapient Creatures</strong></p>
<p>All creatures in the game are sentient, capable of sensing and reacting to the world around them. But only some creatures are sapient, possessed of advanced intellect and consciousness. Being sapient has nothing to do with a creature's Reason score, but is determined solely by whether a creature is capable of human-like levels of thought and emotion. The Director decides whether creatures are sapient for the purpose of being affected by abilities and features that affect only sapient or nonsapient creatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="making-a-power-roll">Making a Power Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-power-roll" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When you make a power roll, you roll two ten-sided dice (usually noted as 2d10 in the rules) and add one of your characteristics. The characteristic you add depends on the kind of roll you're making, as outlined in <a href="#page-83-0">Abilities</a> and <a href="#page-263-0">Tests</a>.</p>
<h5 id="power-roll-outcomes">Power Roll Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#power-roll-outcomes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The total of a power roll determines your outcome tier—three levels that determine how successful your power roll is.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> If your power roll total is <strong>11 or lower</strong>, it is a tier 1 outcome. This is the worst outcome a power roll can have. If you're using an ability, a tier 1 outcome means you still do something, but the impact of what you do is minimal. With this outcome, a strike ability might deal a little bit of damage and not do much else. For a test, a tier 1 outcome might mean you fail at what you set out to do, and you might also incur a negative consequence.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> If your power roll total is <strong>12 to 16</strong>, it is a tier 2 outcome. This is the average outcome of many power rolls, especially for heroes who are 1st level. When using an ability, a tier 2 outcome means that what you do has a moderate impact. With this outcome, a strike ability deals a decent amount of damage and has an effect that briefly helps allies or hinders enemies. For a test, a tier 2 outcome means you might succeed at what you set out to do—though depending on the difficulty, success might have a cost.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> If your power roll total is <strong>17 or higher</strong>, it is a tier 3 outcome. This is the best outcome a power roll can have. When using an ability, a tier 3 outcome means you deliver the maximum impact possible. With this outcome, a strike ability deals a lot of damage and has a powerful or lasting effect on enemies or allies. For a test, a tier 3 outcome means you succeed at what you set out to do. If the test has an easy difficulty, you also get a little something extra in addition to your success.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific outcome of any power roll is determined by the effect or ability that requires the roll (see <a href="#page-83-0">Abilities</a>) or the rules for tests (see <a href="#page-263-0">Tests</a>).</p>
<h5 id="downgrade-a-power-roll">Downgrade a Power Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#downgrade-a-power-roll" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Whenever you make a power roll, you can downgrade it to select the outcome of a lower tier. For instance, if an ability has a tier 3 outcome that lets you impose the restrained condition on a creature, but the tier 2 outcome for that ability lets you impose the slowed condition, you can use the tier 2 outcome if you would rather have the creature slowed than restrained.</p>
<p>If you downgrade a critical hit, you still get the extra action benefit of the critical hit (see <a href="#page-89-0">Critical Hit</a> in <a href="#page-83-2">Classes</a>).</p>
<h5 id="natural-roll">Natural Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-roll" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The total of your power roll before your characteristic or any other modifiers are added is called the natural roll. The rules often refer to this as "rolling a natural X," where X is the total of the roll. For example, if you get a 20 on a power roll before adding your characteristic, this is called rolling a natural 20.</p>
<p>When you roll a natural 19 or 20 on certain types of power rolls, this is a critical hit (see <a href="#page-89-0">Critical Hit</a> in <a href="#page-83-2">Classes</a>).</p>
<h4 id="edges-and-banes">Edges and Banes<a class="headerlink" href="#edges-and-banes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An archer standing on a castle wall fires down into a throng of enemies, hitting the mark each time thanks to their high ground. A drunken bandit struggles to land blows on sober opponents as alcohol clouds their senses. Under certain circumstances, you need more than just a characteristic to represent the advantages and disadvantages that heroes, their enemies, and their allies might have.</p>
<h5 id="edge">Edge<a class="headerlink" href="#edge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>An <strong>edge</strong> represents a situational advantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, a standing hero who makes a melee strike against a prone creature gains an edge on the power roll for their strike. A pair of magic gloves that makes your hands sticky might grant you an edge when making a power roll to climb walls!</p>
<p>When you make a power roll with an edge, you gain a +2 bonus to the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more edges, you have a <strong>double edge</strong>. With a double edge, you don't add anything to the power roll, but the outcome of the roll automatically improves one tier (to a maximum of tier 3).</p>
<h5 id="bane">Bane<a class="headerlink" href="#bane" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A <strong>bane</strong> represents a situational disadvantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, if you make a strike while prone, the power roll for the strike takes a bane. A rainstorm might give you a bane on a power roll made to climb an outdoor wall because the weather makes the stone surface extra slick.</p>
<p>When you make a power roll with a bane, you take a −2 penalty to the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more banes, you have a <strong>double bane</strong>. With a double bane, you don't subtract anything from the power roll, but the outcome of the roll automatically decreases one tier (to a minimum of tier 1).</p>
<h5 id="rolling-with-edges-and-banes">Rolling With Edges and Banes<a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-with-edges-and-banes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you might have one or more edges and banes on the same roll. For instance, you might take a bane when weakened by poison, even as you gain an edge for striking a prone creature. In general, edges and banes cancel each other out, resolving as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an edge and a bane, or if you have a double edge and a double bane, the roll is made as usual without any edges or banes.</li>
<li>If you have a double edge and just one bane, the roll is made with one edge, regardless of how many individual edges contribute to the double edge.</li>
<li>If you have a double bane and just one edge, the roll is made with one bane, regardless of how many individual banes contribute to the double bane.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="when-to-use-edges-and-banes">When to Use Edges and Banes<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-use-edges-and-banes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The rules tell you when to modify a roll with an edge or a bane. The Director can also modify rolls with edges and banes as a response to narrative or environmental circumstances. For instance, no rule</p>
<p>specifically says that rain imposes a bane on power rolls made to climb a stone wall. But it makes sense that rainy conditions should make climbing that wall harder, so a Director should absolutely do so!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Cap?</strong></p>
<p>We capped edges and banes at a maximum of two each for several reasons, including thinking about the narrative of those penalties. Every little advantage or disadvantage in a heroic story has diminishing returns, acknowledging that a creature can benefit or be hindered by short-term circumstances only so much. For example, a character who is prone and weakened by poison already finds it difficult to attack—so that becoming restrained by a net can't really make it harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also liked capping edges and banes at two because it keeps play quick. It's nice to not need to count beyond two positive or negative circumstances in a battle with a lot of effects flying around.</p>
<h4 id="bonuses-and-penalties">Bonuses and Penalties<a class="headerlink" href="#bonuses-and-penalties" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>While edges and banes cover most circumstantial effects that can have an impact on a power roll, a few rules add numeric bonuses or penalties to power rolls. Bonus and penalty values are specified in the rules that impose them, and are calculated independently of edges and banes, and before edges and banes are factored into a power roll. There is no limit to the number of bonuses or penalties that can apply to a power roll, and bonuses and penalties always add together.</p>
<p>Though it might sound as if the math with bonuses and penalties can get confusing, fear not! Bonuses and penalties are rare except in the case of skills, which appear on your character sheet (see <a href="#page-268-0">Skills</a> for more information).</p>
<h4 id="automatic-tier-outcomes">Automatic Tier Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-tier-outcomes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Effects in the game sometimes allow a creature to obtain an automatic tier 1, 2, or 3 outcome on a power roll. Such effects supersede any edges, banes, bonuses, or penalties that might affect the roll. If you obtain an automatic tier outcome and the power roll would have an additional effect if you get a specific roll, such as scoring a critical hit in combat, you can still make the roll to determine if you obtain the additional effect in addition to the automatic outcome.</p>
<p>If you are under multiple effects that each grant you a different automatic outcome, those effects cancel each other out and all automatic outcomes are ignored. If multiple effects grant you the same automatic outcome, you obtain that outcome.</p>
<h3 id="hero-tokens">Hero Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#hero-tokens" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In all great heroic stories, luck favors the protagonists, giving them that little bit of extra fortune they need to win the day. In these stories, fate is often on the side of the righteous. To represent that tiny bit of karma, players have access to hero tokens, a special resource that they can rely on when all else fails.</p>
<p>Hero tokens are a group resource that is tracked by the players and kept in a pool accessible to all their characters. Hero tokens can be tracked using poker chips, stones, or other markers, or can be tallied numerically on a piece of paper or written off to the side in a virtual tabletop.</p>
<h4 id="earning-hero-tokens">Earning Hero Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#earning-hero-tokens" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>At the start of a new game session, the heroes have a number of hero tokens equal to the number of heroes in the party.</p>
<p>Heroes can earn more tokens through play by taking big risks to save others. A hero who leaps off a cliff to reach the bottom and aid a friend, who crosses a burning bridge to save a stray cat, or who wagers their most prized treasure as part of a negotiation to get shelter for a group of refugees might earn a hero token for the group. The Director has the final say regarding which heroic acts earn hero tokens.</p>
<p>Players can also be awarded hero tokens as part of a test's outcome when they succeed on the test with a reward (see <a href="#page-263-0">Tests</a>).</p>
<h4 id="spending-hero-tokens">Spending Hero Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#spending-hero-tokens" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whenever hero tokens are available, you can spend them in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can spend a hero token to gain 2 surges, allowing you to increase the damage or potency of an ability. (See <a href="#page-89-2">Surges</a> in <a href="#page-83-2">Classes</a>.)</li>
<li>You can spend a hero token when you fail a saving throw, letting you succeed on the save instead.</li>
<li>You can spend a hero token to reroll a test. You must use the new roll.</li>
<li>You can spend 2 hero tokens on your turn or when you take damage (no action required) to regain Stamina equal to your Recovery value before taking the damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use only one hero token benefit per turn or per test. Unless the Director decides otherwise, unused hero tokens disappear at the end of a session.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Optional Rule: Hero Tokens Don't Reset</strong></p>
<p>A Director can decide that hero tokens don't refresh at the start of each session and don't disappear at the end of one. This style of play serves many groups who play short sessions consisting of only 2 or 3 hours of play, since it makes hero tokens less abundant and reliable. To use this option, one of the players must note the number of hero tokens available at the end of each session so everyone remembers how many are available the next time you play. The Director should take particular care to remember to award hero tokens for heroic behavior, since the heroes won't get any automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="game-of-exceptions">Game of Exceptions<a class="headerlink" href="#game-of-exceptions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This game has a fair number of rules. But it also has plenty of character options, specialized equipment, and other game elements that let you break those rules. This is on purpose! Breaking the rules allows heroes to feel special and makes their foes feel extra dangerous.</p>
<p>If you're not sure what to do when two rules come into conflict with each other, remember that a specific exception always beats a more general rule. The Director has the final say in how rules are adjudicated.</p>
<h3 id="always-round-down">Always Round Down<a class="headerlink" href="#always-round-down" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the rules tell you to divide a number in half. Whenever you divide an odd number in half and it results in a decimal, round the result down to the nearest whole number. For instance, if a tactician takes 7 damage and uses the Parry ability in response—a triggered action that halves the damage—then the damage is reduced to 3.</p>
<h3 id="creatures-and-objects">Creatures and Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#creatures-and-objects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><em>Draw Steel</em> uses the terms "creature" and "object" when referring to the targets of abilities and other effects. Creatures are living or unliving beings such as animals, elves, humans, dragons, giants, zombies, and valok. Objects are inanimate matter such as walls, carriages, cups, swords, ropes, coins, paintings, columns, and buildings.</p>
<p>When a creature dies, their body becomes an object, and is affected by abilities and other effects as an object, not a creature. For example, an elementalist can't use their Return to Formlessness ability to set an enemy cult leader on fire. But if that leader dies, the elementalist can immolate their body to prevent them from being raised as a powerful undead by the temple's magic.</p>
<h4 id="unattended-objects">Unattended Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#unattended-objects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The game sometimes refers to "unattended objects," which are objects that aren't held, worn, or controlled by a creature. Whenever an ability or other effect targets objects, it affects only unattended objects unless the Director determines otherwise. Among other things, this prevents abilities from being used to damage a foe's armor, weapons, clothing, treasures, and so forth while those objects are worn or held.</p>
<h3 id="supernatural-or-mundane">Supernatural or Mundane<a class="headerlink" href="#supernatural-or-mundane" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The word supernatural is used to describe abilities, creatures, objects, and effects that are magic or psionic in nature. The word mundane is used to describe abilities, creatures, objects, and effects that aren't magic or psionic.</p>
<h3 id="pcs-and-npcs">PCs and NPCs<a class="headerlink" href="#pcs-and-npcs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Two types of characters inhabit the world of the game—the player characters (also called PCs or heroes) who are created and controlled by the players, and nonplayer characters (NPCs) created and controlled by the Director. NPCs can include any of the game's monsters, but when the rules refer to NPCs, they generally do so in the context of interacting with them outside of combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bags of Rats Ain't Heroic</strong></p>
<p>Some players might think that quickly starting a fight with some bar patrons or carrying around a bag of rats is a good way to gather up those sweet, sweet Victories and Heroic Resources. Those strategies don't work! The rules of the game exist to help you tell a cool heroic fantasy story, not so you can try to be clever and exploit them by harming innocent rats to "win." In order to generate Victories and Heroic Resources, you must face and overcome challenges worthy of a hero!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="building-a-heroic-narrative">Building a Heroic Narrative<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-heroic-narrative" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The game takes place in a series of scenes with the heroes as the main characters. An adventure is a collection of scenes that make up a story, with a beginning, middle, and end, and a campaign is a collection of adventures that tell the entire epic tale of a group of heroes. You can think of each adventure as a movie in a saga of films, a book in a series of novels, or a season of a television show. While many heroes have their stories told over the course of a campaign, some wrap up their careers in a single adventure that takes place in one game session, called a one-shot. You can think of a one-shot as a great stand-alone novella or movie.</p>
<p>This game is built so that each adventure you play and each battle you fight gets more exciting as it goes on. In fantastic tales, the heroes and their foes both grow in power over the course of an adventure. But it isn't time alone that grows a hero's capabilities. Rather, it's the adrenaline that comes from battle, the danger of the hero's profession, and the pressure to save the world—or at least some small part of it that pushes a character to do the impossible. Each small act of heroism gives a hero the confidence and bravery to perform legendary feats against all odds.</p>
<p>The things a hero can achieve at the end of the story are far more daring and impactful than what they do at the start, and the final showdown against a villain's forces is more deadly and desperate than the first. The rules of the game help build a heroic narrative in this same fashion, making use of the four most important mechanics for building heroic narratives: Victories, Experience, Heroic Resources, and Recoveries.</p>
<h4 id="victories">Victories<a class="headerlink" href="#victories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Victories measure your hero's increasing power over the course of an adventure, as they overcome battles and other challenges. At the start of an adventure, your hero has 0 Victories.</p>
<h5 id="victories-for-combat">Victories For Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#victories-for-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Each time your hero survives a combat encounter in which the party's objectives are achieved, you earn 1 Victory. The Director can decide that a trivially easy encounter doesn't earn the heroes a Victory, and can award additional Victories for particularly challenging encounters.</p>
<h5 id="victories-for-noncombat-challenges">Victories For Noncombat Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#victories-for-noncombat-challenges" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When your hero successfully overcomes a big challenge that doesn't involve combat, the Director can award you 1 Victory. Such challenges can include things such as a particularly complicated and deadly trap, a negotiation, a montage test, a complicated puzzle, or the execution of a clever idea that avoids a battle. Especially difficult challenges might earn you more than 1 Victory.</p>
<h5 id="victories-reset">Victories Reset<a class="headerlink" href="#victories-reset" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Whenever you finish a respite (see <a href="#page-21-4">Respite</a> below), your Victories are converted into Experience.</p>
<h4 id="experience">Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#experience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Victories temporarily increase a hero's power during an adventure, but Experience (abbreviated "XP") permanently improves their capabilities. Each time you finish a respite (see below), you gain XP equal to your Victories, then your Victories reset to 0. In other words, your Victories are converted to XP when you finish a respite.</p>
<p>For more information on how XP increases your hero's power, see <a href="#page-32-1">Heroic Advancement</a> in <a href="#page-29-1">Making a Hero</a>.</p>
<h4 id="heroic-resources">Heroic Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#heroic-resources" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your hero has a Heroic Resource determined by your class, and which you manage during play. Earning your Heroic Resources can increase your hero's power, and you spend your Heroic Resources to activate your most powerful abilities.</p>
<p>Your hero's class description has more information about how to use your Heroic Resource.</p>
<h4 id="recoveries">Recoveries<a class="headerlink" href="#recoveries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Recoveries represent the number of times your hero can take a breather and keep fighting. Spending Recoveries lets you regain Stamina—the measure of any creature's physical vitality and capacity to shrug off or avoid damage (see <a href="#page-291-0">Stamina</a> in <a href="#page-279-4">Combat</a>). Running out of Recoveries means your hero has reached their uttermost limit.</p>
<p>When you spend a Recovery, you regain Stamina equal to your <strong>recovery value</strong>, which is one-third your Stamina maximum. You can spend your Recoveries with a special maneuver (see below), or you might do so with a little supernatural help from a conduit, a boost of adrenaline from an allied tactician, or inspiration from your party's troubadour.</p>
<h5 id="spending-recoveries">Spending Recoveries<a class="headerlink" href="#spending-recoveries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>During combat encounters and similarly dangerous situations when time is tracked in rounds (see <a href="#page-279-4">Combat</a>), you can use the Catch Breath maneuver to regain Stamina. (See <a href="#page-287-2">Catch Breath</a> in <a href="#page-287-0">Maneuvers</a> for more information.) Some heroes have abilities that allow them or their allies to spend more Recoveries without using the Catch Breath maneuver.</p>
<p>Outside of combat and other dangerous situations, you can spend Recoveries freely.</p>
<h5 id="regaining-recoveries">Regaining Recoveries<a class="headerlink" href="#regaining-recoveries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You regain all lost Recoveries when you finish a respite (see below).</p>
<h4 id="respite">Respite<a class="headerlink" href="#respite" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A respite is a focused period of rest and recuperation that allows heroes to regain Stamina and Recoveries. During a respite, you must spend 24 hours uninterrupted and doing nothing but sleeping, eating, dressing your wounds, and recuperating. You can also undertake one respite activity, such as making a project roll (see <a href="#page-307-2">Downtime Projects</a>) or changing your kit (see <a href="#page-239-0">Kits</a>).</p>
<p>After 24 hours, your respite ends. When you finish a respite, you regain all your Recoveries and Stamina, and your Victories convert to Experience. You can take as many respites as you like in a row to keep accomplishing respite activities. Just keep in mind that while you're resting, your enemies are still scheming and carrying out their dastardly plans.</p>
<p>It is best to take a respite in a safe place where you aren't in a hostile environment or at risk of being attacked. If your respite is interrupted by enemies attacking, an earth tremor, swarms of biting insects, and similar serious distractions, the respite ends early and you don't gain the benefits for finishing it.</p>
<p>The standard 8-or-so hours of sleep one gets at night doesn't count as a respite. The rules assume that all heroes take the time to sleep, eat, and take care of all the other functions necessary for life even if they aren't engaged in a respite.</p>
<h3 id="echelons-of-play">Echelons of Play<a class="headerlink" href="#echelons-of-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The core gameplay experience of <em>Draw Steel</em> takes place over ten levels of play. At 1st level, player characters are already known as heroes and have the power to save their local village. By the time the characters are 10th level, people all over the world—maybe even across all worlds know the names of their saviors!</p>
<p>Since this game encompasses power levels from hometown to demigods, the core experience has been divided into four different echelons. Each echelon determines the types of threats the heroes can take on, the stakes of their stories, and the rewards they receive at the various levels of play.</p>
<h4 id="1st-echelon-1st-to-3rd-level">1st Echelon (1st to 3rd Level)<a class="headerlink" href="#1st-echelon-1st-to-3rd-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The 1st echelon of play details the stories of characters of 1st to 3rd level. At this echelon, the characters are local heroes. They save lost caravans, besieged villages, and overlooked neighborhoods within cities. Characters battle bands of mortal humanoids—dwarves, elves, goblins, humans, kobolds, orcs, and more. They can also face off against the occasional larger monstrous threat, such as a bredbeddle, ogre, or chimera. Such creatures can threaten a small community but rarely have plans for world domination or the destruction of the timescape. However, any of these adversaries might work for or be manipulated by stronger threats as a foreshadowing of what awaits the heroes at higher echelons.</p>
<h4 id="2nd-echelon-4th-to-6th-level">2nd Echelon (4th to 6th Level)<a class="headerlink" href="#2nd-echelon-4th-to-6th-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The 2nd echelon of play covers 4th to 6th level. At this echelon, the heroes are now known throughout the wider region they serve. In Vasloria, this means the characters might save and be celebrated by an entire country. In Capital, their reputation and work could encompass several different neighborhoods of the enormous city. Heroes of the timescape might be known for saving a planet!</p>
<p>Heroes in this echelon battle humanoids of great supernatural power, such as draconians, devils, and hobgoblins. They face bosses possessed of cunning and ambition as great as their terrible influence, such as medusas and overminds. Heroes at this level also face the humanoid threats of earlier levels, but those foes are villainous counterparts of equal power rather than bands of ruffians or marauding armies.</p>
<h4 id="3rd-echelon-7th-to-9th-level">3rd Echelon (7th to 9th Level)<a class="headerlink" href="#3rd-echelon-7th-to-9th-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The 3rd echelon of play covers 7th to 9th level. At this echelon, the heroes are saving and are known throughout the setting where they serve. Most folks in Vasloria, Capital, or across the larger timescape know of the heroes and are grateful for their efforts saving the continent, the entire city, or multiple worlds, respectively. Foes at this echelon include beings of great power such as giants, vampires, and valok.</p>
<h4 id="4th-echelon-10th-level">4th Echelon (10th Level)<a class="headerlink" href="#4th-echelon-10th-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The 4th echelon of play explores the stories of characters of 10th level (and might even go beyond in future products). At this echelon, heroes are saving the entire timescape from threats such as liches, powerful dragons, and overlords like Ajax the Invincible.</p>
<h3 id="orden-and-the-timescape">Orden and the Timescape<a class="headerlink" href="#orden-and-the-timescape" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A new game demands new worlds! Welcome to the timescape—a collection of worlds spanning high fantasy, dark fantasy, even space fantasy!</p>
<p>Our tour begins on the world of Orden, the prime manifold, where humans, elves, dwarves, and orcs share a world with dragons, goblins, kobolds, and dozens of other speaking peoples. But human civilization and politics dominate here.</p>
<p>Orden contains eight major regions, the largest of which is Vasloria.</p>
<h4 id="vasloria">Vasloria<a class="headerlink" href="#vasloria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A forested, medieval, feudal land, Vasloria is peppered with few cities, mostly just towns and villages. While there will someday be nations here with proper borders, as of now in the Age of Chaos those nations are merely geographic areas with names people use to distinguish lands that share similar terrain and subcultures.</p>
<p>Aendrim, the land of hills and farms. Corwell with its knights and castles. The marshlands of Tull where witches and wise women battle hags and swamp monsters. The thick forests of Farrow with its bands of archers, and the horselands of Graid home to the best cavalry in Orden.</p>
<p>Mountainous northeastern Vasloria is home to the small earldoms of Sednia, Olvaria, and Sărda, and the earldom of Rhöl containing the land of Glauer once ruled by a deathless count.</p>
<p>Scattered across it all, Vasloria boasts the densest collection of elf-haunted wodes in Orden. All regions have wodes, but Vasloria's northern border is the Great Wode where the world still works as it did before humans arrived.</p>
<p>Within the wodes, time misbehaves. Cause and effect are only distant cousins, as all lands were before Ord placed the dwarves in the world,</p>
<p>imposing the Law of Time on Orden. Children's tales of villagers wandering into a wode and emerging unchanged 100 years later are based on real events. When pressed on how this "works," the elves look baffled. "How does what work?"</p>
<h5 id="omunds-land">Omund's Land<a class="headerlink" href="#omunds-land" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Western Vasloria, including most of Aendrim and Corwell and parts of Graid, was until recently ruled by Good King Omund. His draconian knights, the Dragon Phalanx, protected the weak from the strong, dispensing justice. Omund's rule lasted 35 years and in his life this area was known as Omund's Land.</p>
<p>Under Omund's rule, order thrived. Roads were safe. People could even walk into the woods unafraid of meeting anything more threatening than a nymph or conversational manticore.</p>
<p>Omund died 15 years ago and so died the rule of law. Now the forest claims the towns and roads once held safe. The woods are dangerous. Their only law … tooth and claw.</p>
<p>Omund was betrayed and his castle fell to Ajax the Invincible, now called the Iron Saint. His wizard Mortum unlocked the secret of the ancient sky elf flying cities, and raised the Chrysopolis, Ajax's city-fortress in the sky.</p>
<p>It was Mortum who used the secrets of the synliroi body banks, granting immortality to those nobles who voluntarily submit to Ajax. Those same body banks produce Ajax's war dogs, his brutal, patchwork-soldiers who owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically.</p>
<p>Ajax abolished all faiths and temples. He executed the dukes who organized and united the barons, leaving the far-flung baronies to try and hold human civilization together. Once, these people were loose allies. There was trade between humans, elves, dwarves and orcs.</p>
<p>Now there is only suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>The high elves of the fallen city</strong> pay tribute with ancient artifacts they plunder from the fallen celestial city of Irranys. <strong>The wode elves of the Orchid Court</strong>, lacking any centralized government or cities, refuse to bow to Ajax.</p>
<p><strong>The dwarves of Kal Kalavar</strong> pay tribute in prisoners they abduct from those foolish enough to travel the roads unescorted. These prisoners serve Ajax as forced labor or are fed into the body banks. Brooding under the mountains in their fabled Hanging City, the stone dwarves do not like this deal with the Overlord but lack the power—or the will—to rebel.</p>
<p><strong>The Hawklords of the High Aeries</strong>, once remote and proud, almost mythical to the people below, made their own pact with Ajax to avoid extermination. They now serve as his elite counterinsurgent force. Mounted on their giant hawks, they project Ajax's power, enforce his law and extend his influence into every corner of the wilderness. Their mastery of the air means any revolt or rebellion is quickly seen and crushed.</p>
<p><strong>The Dragon Phalanx</strong> is broken. Ajax placed a high bounty on its warriors' heads. Some folk still see Omund's knights as symbols of justice, heroes of a lost age before might made right. But in every town, every village, there are always desperate people willing to collect the bounty, summoning the Hawklords to pluck any dragon knight foolish enough to travel without a disguise away to the Chrysopolis.</p>
<p>Isolated and outnumbered, the human baronies desperately fight a losing battle against the encroaching wilderness. Order dies. Chaos thrives.</p>
<h4 id="capital">Capital<a class="headerlink" href="#capital" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Greatest City in This or Any Age! City of the Great Game! Located west across the Bale Sea from Vasloria, on the eastern coast of Rioja, Capital is not only the largest city in Orden—it's the largest city there has ever been. Larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.</p>
<p>It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic where flying tapestries act as taxis, the reality of living in Capital is somewhat more mundane. Only the very wealthy can afford such luxuries.</p>
<p>The great houses, ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think vast wealth entitles them to rule. The great houses are very proud of their city. They believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, expect justice. They just don't think anyone else should be able to <em>rule</em>.</p>
<p>The guilds, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, and largely obsessed with accruing wealth, city be damned. Three of them recently used their obscene wealth to buy great house status and now play the great game with the best of them.</p>
<p>The "great game" is espionage, and <strong>House Alvaro</strong> are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsor the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. While the greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the colleges in the university, which has historically doubled as the prince's intelligence agency.</p>
<p><strong>House Vorona</strong> run the city's navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy's cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona's Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing Capital has to a city-wide law enforcement organization. Each great house is expected to police its own district.</p>
<p>Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring that gives Vorona access to intelligence other factions can only dream of.</p>
<p><strong>House Navarr</strong>, oldest of the great houses, enforces the church's law, which they call justice. Led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of the most powerful church in the city—the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless—House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and orders of knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.</p>
<p>Arguably the most powerful great house, <strong>House Valetta</strong> controls the Arbitros Fiat, the tax collectors. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore who, in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, opened the <em>Codex Mortis</em> and spoke the ritual which should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed every mortal in her district, including herself, into deathless revenants. Now, the Duchess Lenore is an immortal vampire queen. A dead lady, ruling over a dead city.</p>
<p>After the Lilac Night, when the prince was no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes they collected, Lady Shirome</p>
<p>coordinated with two other guilds to buy Great House status for themselves.</p>
<p>Lady Shirome runs the city's assayers guild, <strong>the Fulcrum</strong>. The guild controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was the Fulcrum that convinced the prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Broadsheets, formally known as <strong>the Font</strong>, publish the thrice-daily news sheets everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in the city.</p>
<p>The Farrier's Guild, popularly known as <strong>the Rasp</strong>, control transport throughout the city. Led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from Alloy who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the 13-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He created the <strong>Kites</strong>, couriers famous for getting a message anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. Kashimir's monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives him enormous power, and he is not shy about seeking more.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the prince of Capital died leaving no heir or even a likely candidate. He was a young man, only forty-one, but the events surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and inaccurate accounts. Was he murdered like a commoner, or assassinated by a political rival? Evidence is scant, rumor substitutes as fact.</p>
<p>Now the great game takes on a new meaning as the four great houses and three newly ascendant guilds jockey for position, each wanting to step into the power vacuum left by the dead prince. Everyone knows a war is coming, a war of succession that means fighting on the street. But each player in the game would much prefer it if someone <em>else</em> made the first move.</p>
<h4 id="the-myriad-worlds-of-the-timescape">The Myriad Worlds of the Timescape<a class="headerlink" href="#the-myriad-worlds-of-the-timescape" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Orden is only one world in the timescape! Each star in the night sky is another, though this fact is not known to most people living on Orden. Old fashioned people still use the archaic term "plane" to describe these worlds, while sages use geometric formulae, describing these worlds they call "manifolds," but they all mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Higher worlds are more energetic, affording access to alien technologies. Great starfreighters ply the space-lanes, and knights wield psionically powered hard-light blades dueling against star pirates with hard-light blasters.</p>
<p>The lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such extraordinary technology to function, and so rely on magic to break the rules.</p>
<p>On Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL, the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade across the upper worlds, defending the starfreighters from the time raiders and the infamous pirate band the Starslayers on their legendary ship the K.R.A.D.1 <em>Fearless</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the formless proteans rebelled against the synliroi who once ruled the Plane of Uttermost Chaos, exiling the voiceless talkers to the World Below. Now masters of their world, the proteans take to the stars in their living changeships, hurling their small fleet against the tyrannical unquestioned might of UNISOL.</p>
<p>On Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds, proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire dwarves, even humans in Quintessence's capital city of Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the gateway to the timescape. People travelling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible law of UNISOL.</p>
<p>Traveling downward from Quintessence one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. Technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind or the miracle mineral iridoss, also known as prismacore.</p>
<p>Almost coterminal with Orden is its sister-manifold, the World Below, the Dark Under All, a plane of exiles ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star's Silver, the Queen of Night, first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves, and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, only endless caverns and warrens, some vast enough to hold entire cities, like Or-Mazaar City of the Black Star from which the Queen of Night rules.</p>
<p>The power of the World Below wanes, while the power of Equinox waxes. A smaller, parasitic manifold home to the twilight celestials and their servants the shadow elves, Equinox is ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below who plots to bridge the sea between worlds and colonize Orden making a new home for her people before their old world dies. A fierce, fairy-tale, weird magic, jungle world of permanent twilight also known as Dusk.</p>
<p>The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell is among the lowest of the lower planes. A land of devils proud of their civilization, each of the seven cities is ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. A world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more <em>interesting</em> down here.</p>
<p>The seven archdevils conspired together once; agreeing to create the Order of Desolation—also known as the Illriggers—to extend their power into the timescape, and defend Hell from the horde of demons below.</p>
<p>The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience and gain identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upwards, out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identity, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.</p>
<p>At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City, a city of the dead, ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the Heliopolis.</p>
<h4 id="setting-design">Setting Design<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-design" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Orden and the timescape were both designed over the last 25 years to be an explicitly commercial setting. A product where you could find all the things everyone expects to find in a classic fantasy setting, with new takes on classic tropes and a little more "Why are things like this?" work done to ground everything and make things feel plausible. None of this makes Orden "better" than other settings, it just gives it character.</p>
<p>Orden is not explicitly a high fantasy world, even though there are some pretty high fantasy things going on in it, because the average person has <em>very little</em> access to magic. The typical village might have a priest who knows some real prayers that close wounds or cure minor ailments, or an alchemist or hedge wizard who can brew some potions or conjure minor spells, but that's the extent of it. The result is, though Orden is a pre-industrial world with technology and societies akin to 13th-century Europe, the quality of life of the people who live there is a lot closer to ours. They live about as long as we do, die from disease about as often as we do, and generally have diets similar to ours, though with vastly more basic and constricted options on their menus.</p>
<p>In Capital, for instance, people use flying tapestries to get around the city quickly, but these are a luxury available only to the rich. The vast majority of Capital's citizens live a life basically the same as your average Londoner in Shakespeare's time. Less plague and fire, though.</p>
<p>It's not clear to us, looking in, but it doesn't seem as though Orden operates according to the real-world laws of physics, chemistry, and biology. People in the middle ages here on Earth didn't know about quarks or DNA, but they still knew everything was made of "stuff" and everyone expected a child to more or less resemble their parents. Essentially, Orden works the way people living in any culture's medieval era believed the real world actually worked. Because of the presence of magic, prayer, and psionics in the world, it's unlikely anything like science or an industrial age will <em>ever</em> come to Orden.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while there are 10th-level characters out there, these are exceedingly rare. Most people in Orden do not have class levels. Only a few are 1st level anything! No one has ever tried to take a census of all the censors, conduits, furies, and so forth, but if they did, they'd probably end up with a chart that looks a lot like Zipf's Law.</p>
<p>Finally, most information about Orden and the timescape is presented from the point of view of someone living in Orden. They can tell you what they think they know, but even learned historians do not agree, and new information constantly comes to light challenging the accepted academic wisdom. Just like … you get it.</p>
<p>This lack of objective certainty not only makes it more fun for us to work on Orden, it makes it easier for you to make Orden yours. This comes at the price of certainty. (Are the Dragon Phalanx <em>really</em> "incorruptible?" Well, a lot of people still say that! In spite of concrete evidence to the contrary!) But we think it helps relieve some of the anxiety Directors have when they want to run a game in Orden but are afraid they don't know "enough" or "everything." Not to worry. No one knows everything!</p>
<p>P.S. We use the phrase "Orden and the timescape" because Orden is, as it were, the star of the show. But Orden is very clearly only one world <em>in</em> the timescape. It's like those astronomy maps hanging on the wall in your grade school science class that said, "Earth and the solar system." Like that map, any map of the timescape will be an artist's interpretation, not drawn to scale, and never wholly accurate depending on what information you're looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Timescape in Your Game</strong></p>
<p>We use the timescape and its medieval fantasyland Orden as the default setting presented in these books. Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy world. We also think it's easier for you to take the names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them with your own. We might reference some hero or villain, saint or god, whose name makes you think, "Well, I don't have that in my setting." If we do a good job, though, you might be inspired to say, "But that makes me think …" And being inspired is part of the fun!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're the Director, you can use as many or as few of the details of the timescape as you like. You might wish to create your own world within the timescape, or use a setting you've created that exists outside of the official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from settings published by other companies. There are no rules when it comes to worldbuilding. Feel free to take what you like from this book and change the rest. For example, you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone skin. That's fine. You can make them fleshy, stout, bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers, or anything else you wish. As long as you're running a heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the game's rules are still likely to serve your narrative even if that narrative deviates from ours.</p>
<p>If you're a player, ask your Director about the setting where the game takes place and discuss with them the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest discussion with your Director can lead to everyone getting what they want out of the game.</p>

<h1 id="making-a-hero">Making a Hero<a class="headerlink" href="#making-a-hero" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>If you're not the Director, then you create and play one of the main characters in the game's story—a hero. Your hero is a person motivated to fight forces of evil to protect the innocent, but each hero has their own personal reason for doing so. You don't have to be a pure beacon of good. Heroes have flaws and are complex, just like people in the real world. But your hero should be someone who isn't afraid to battle monsters for altruistic reasons. If you're only interested in playing a money-grubbing sellsword, you can achieve that with these rules, but you'll likely be happier playing another game.</p>
<p>The hero you create will be roleplayed by you. Often when referring to your hero, the rules use second-person pronouns (you/your) for shorthand, making a distinction between you and your hero only when that distinction is important.</p>
<h3 id="your-first-session">Your First Session<a class="headerlink" href="#your-first-session" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Getting together with your friends to make characters can be a lot of fun. Many groups spend most of their first session talking about the campaign's story, making heroes, and going over expectations for the game. It's a great way to kick off a long-term campaign.</p>
<p>The Director should make an agenda for a campaign's first session often called "session zero." <a href="#page-387-0">Chapter 15: For the Director</a> has all the information a Director needs to help organize a successful first session, which can include any of the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Director and players talk about the safety tools they want to employ at the game table (whether physical or virtual), so that everyone has a good time and understands which topics should be avoided in the game's narrative and which should be embraced. For more information, check out the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit at <em><a href="http://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit">mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit</a></em>, which includes advice for running a successful first session.</li>
<li>The Director discusses the campaign's world and the major story themes they want to introduce into the game. This often takes the form of a campaign pitch the Director presents to the players.</li>
<li>The Director should tell the players if any options are limited or rare in their campaign. For example, some Directors don't want psionics to appear in their game worlds, so they might decide that heroes can't be nulls or talents. Another campaign might be grounded in more typical medieval fantasy and not have any memonek or time raiders, or those ancestries might be exceedingly rare. In the latter case, players should know that their memonek or time raider heroes are likely to get a lot of questions from curious NPCs.</li>
<li>The players get a chance to tell the Director what they would like to experience in the campaign. This can include anything from "I'd love to play out some chase scenes!" to "I want to explore themes of loss and grief." These wishes should be starting points for a conversation. If not all players are comfortable with certain themes or content requested by other players, then session zero is a great time to discuss that and come to a consensus about what everyone wants out of the game.</li>
<li>Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the campaign is about, it's the perfect time to get into character creation. When a group of players make heroes together, they can tie backstories together and strategize to build a tactically dominant party both in and out of combat.</li>
<li>The Director runs an encounter to kick off the campaign. If all the players have the time, it's totally worth it to get some play in during the first session, even if it's just a quick brawl in a tavern with some cultists! Starting off with a little action lets you see what the game is all about—and raises anticipation for the next session.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-by-step-hero-making">Step-by-Step Hero Making<a class="headerlink" href="#step-by-step-hero-making" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Use the following step-by-step guide to create a hero. These steps are presented in what we believe is the best way to approach making your first hero for <em>Draw Steel</em>. That said, the order of the steps is still a suggestion, not a hard and fast rule.</p>
<p>Many players like to build a hero from the backstory up, making ancestry and culture ideal first choices. However, some players like to start more in the present, choosing a career and a class—the choices with the most potential impact on what your character can do in the game—and then going back and figuring out where their hero came from. There's no wrong way to do it! (The sections below tell you where to look to learn about ancestries, classes, and other options.)</p>
<p>You'll want a character sheet to fill out while you make your hero.</p>
<p>Each option you can choose for your hero at 1st level includes a parenthetical selection labeled "Quick Build." This is for players who want to build a character faster without reading through all the available options, by choosing the most straightforward and archetypal option for a hero. Most quick build options don't select languages for you, because your Director knows better than us which languages will be most useful in your campaign. In addition to being called out in the text, quick build ability options within classes are indicated by a gold icon.</p>
<p>If this is your first time making a hero, don't stress! The first time you build a character for <em>Draw Steel</em>, it might take an hour or so. Don't rush the process. Set aside some time, enjoy digging into all the options, and if you can, make your character alongside friends who are playing in the same game. The process gets a lot faster after you've done it once.</p>

<h4 id="1-think">1. Think<a class="headerlink" href="#1-think" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The first thing you should do is think about the kind of hero you want to make. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you fight with weapons, magic, psionics, or some combination of these capabilities?</li>
<li>Outside of combat, what do you want your hero to do well?</li>
<li>What did you do before becoming a hero?</li>
<li>Why did you choose to become a hero?</li>
<li>What is your personality like?</li>
<li>What people, places, and objects are important to you?</li>
<li>How will your hero complement the strengths and weaknesses of the other heroes in your party?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ambition is Good!</strong></p>
<p>Heroes aren't just along for the ride in the Director's story. They're active participants in that story, making decisions that change their communities, their worlds, or even the entirety of the timescape! It's good for your hero to have desires—to want to found an organization, seek justice for someone who was wronged, or craft a magic sword that will help you defeat your foes. It's only when that personal ambition becomes more important than the group's story that it creates a potential problem. But if you share your character's ambitions with your Director, they can weave those desires in with the narrative. Character creation is a great time to do this.</p>
<p>As the story evolves, your hero's ambitions could change. That's not a bad thing—dynamic characters are awesome! But if your hero ends up pursuing different goals over time, make sure you have a conversation with your Director about it, so they can plan accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="2-ancestry">2. Ancestry<a class="headerlink" href="#2-ancestry" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Choose your hero's humanoid ancestry from among the range of ancestries available in the game—devil, dragon knight, dwarf, wode elf, high elf, hakaan, human, memonek, orc, polder, revenant, or time raider. Future supplements will introduce additional ancestries you can choose from. See <a href="#page-35-0">Chapter 3: Ancestries</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="3-culture">3. Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#3-culture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Choose or create your hero's culture. Although ancestry gives your hero any number of physiological benefits, your culture describes the community that raised you and gives you languages and skills. See <a href="#page-67-1">Culture</a> in <a href="#page-67-0">Chapter 4: Background</a> for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Choosing Skills</strong></p>
<p>This game has lots of skills (as detailed in <a href="#page-268-0">Skills</a> in Chapter 9: Tests), and lots of opportunities during character creation to gain them. We recommend recording a list of all the skills you might choose from the different steps of the character creation process, then making your choices at the end of that process rather than flipping back and forth through the book.</p>
<p>If you gain the same specific skill from two different sources (for instance, from a career and a class), you can pick a different skill from any skill group.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="4-career">4. Career<a class="headerlink" href="#4-career" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Choose your hero's career, which describes what you did for a living before you became a hero. A career provides you with skills, an inciting incident that precipitated your adventuring career, and a perk that lets you customize your hero. It might also grant you languages, Renown, wealth, or the potential to undertake crafting and research. See Careers in Chapter 4: Background for more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I Speak Their Language</strong></p>
<p>Choosing languages at the start of a campaign can be hard because you might not know which languages are going to be most prevalent or useful. You can choose to leave some of the languages you know open until you discover what might be a good choice for the campaign you're playing in. Once you decide to take a language, you can reveal your choice in a dramatic fashion, perhaps during a negotiation where knowing a specific language would help, or when you find a tome that no other hero in your party can read.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="5-class">5. Class<a class="headerlink" href="#5-class" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Choose your hero's class. This choice has the biggest impact on how your hero interacts with the rules of the game, particularly the rules for combat. Your class provides your starting characteristic scores that determine your character's physical and mental acumen, as well as the Stamina and Recoveries that determine your physical hardiness. A class also provides your character with skills, several abilities—the unique features that define what your hero can do—and other features and benefits. You can be a censor, conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, talent, or troubadour. See Chapter 5: Classes for more information on each class, as well as the different types of abilities signature abilities, heroic abilities, and more—that heroes of a specific class have access to.</p>
<h4 id="6-kit">6. Kit<a class="headerlink" href="#6-kit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your class might grant your hero a kit that helps define your approach to martial combat. The kit you choose provides you with equipment and a fighting style that grants a signature ability, as well as bonuses to one or more of your game statistics. See Chapter 6: Kits for more information.</p>
<h4 id="7-add-free-strikes">7. Add Free Strikes<a class="headerlink" href="#7-add-free-strikes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A free strike is a combat ability you can use when it's not your turn, representing the simplest and most basic weapon attack you can make. An enemy is foolish enough to walk away from you in melee? Free strike! Every hero has a melee weapon free strike and a ranged weapon free strike. They're all the same—until modified by your kit or class—and it's up to you to decide what exactly your free strikes are. A thrown dagger? A punch? The design is intended to let you use your imagination.</p>
<p>You can also make free strikes on your turn to represent using weapons your hero isn't otherwise themed to use. A wode elf master archer can stab a too-close enemy with a dagger as a free strike, and a greataxe-wielding orc fury can use a free strike to hurl a handaxe at a flying enemy staying annoyingly out of melee range.</p>
<p>See Free Strikes in Chapter 10: Combat for more information on using free strikes, and see Abilities in Chapter 5: Classes for information on the ability format and how to read it.</p>

<h4 id="8-complication">8. Complication<a class="headerlink" href="#8-complication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Complications represent those dramatic moments in a character's backstory that give them pathos, a dramatic reason to be an outsider, doubts about the meaning of life, an urge to avoid intimacy, or an unstoppable vendetta against an enemy from the past. Each complica tion grants a benefit and a drawback that make a character more three dimensional, but complications aren't necessary for making a great hero. Check with your Director as to whether your game is using them, and see Chapter 8: Complications for more information.</p>
<h4 id="9-determine-details">9. Determine Details<a class="headerlink" href="#9-determine-details" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Once you've created your hero, it's time to determine the additional details of their backstory, appearance, and personality. How do the events of their culture, career and inciting incident, and class tie together into a cohesive narrative? What's their name? What do they look like? Do they have any cool scars? Any sweet tattoos? Do they still sleep with their teddy bear? These kinds of details can help define a well-rounded hero.</p>
<h4 id="10-make-connections">10. Make Connections<a class="headerlink" href="#10-make-connections" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Ask the Director if all the heroes start the campaign knowing each other. If they do, talk to the other players and build some connections between your characters. If you like, you can use the following prompts to make those connections, or to come up with prompts of your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you were fighting a monster, one of the party members saved your life. What were you battling and who saved you?</li>
<li>In your group, who looks after everyone's health and well-being, and makes sure that all the characters get along? If it's not you, how do you view this other hero?</li>
<li>Who is the grumpiest member of your party? If it isn't you, how do you react to that hero's sour nature? If it is you, how do you react to other characters teasing you or trying to cheer you up?</li>
<li>What's one thing your fellow heroes know about you that other people do not?</li>
<li>What's your favorite way to bond with your fellow heroes?</li>
<li>You've known one of the other heroes in your party longer than the rest. Who is it, and how did you meet?</li>
<li>Another hero creates food, music, clothing, trinkets, or something else that you enjoy. Who is that hero, and what do they make?</li>
<li>Another hero is teaching you a new skill. Who is it, and what are they teaching you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer these questions with the other players present, and be sure to get a player's approval if your answer makes use of their character.</p>
<h3 id="adventuring-gear">Adventuring Gear<a class="headerlink" href="#adventuring-gear" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><em>Draw Steel</em> isn't a game about tracking gear, so you don't need to list every piece of equipment you own on your character sheet. The game assumes that heroes generally have enough to eat and drink, so the rules don't expect you to track food and water either.</p>
<p>If your character has a skill that implicitly requires gear, such as lockpicks for the Pick Lock skill or basic alchemy supplies for use with the Alchemy skill, then you have that gear. Likewise, your character is assumed to have standard useful adventuring gear, including a torch, a rope, and a backpack at minimum.</p>
<p>At the Director's discretion, you might lose certain gear during an adventure, or your gear could break. If this happens, you might not be able to perform certain tasks as effectively without that gear.</p>
<h3 id="changing-character-options">Changing Character Options<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-character-options" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you pick a skill, ability, class, or any other option that you end up not liking after using it in the game—even your character's ancestry—you can always freely change that option between game sessions. If you want to change some aspect of your character during a session, ask your Director. If they say it's fine to swap that aspect out for something else, go for it. You shouldn't be stuck with any option that makes the game less fun for you.</p>
<p>If you're changing an option for some reason other than fun, you need to follow the usual rules for changing that option. For example, you might want to swap a kit out because you think the next adventure is going to require you to have better distance with weapon strikes, doing so during a respite as talked about in Chapter 6: Kits. If no rule for swapping out an option exists, such as wanting to change a signature ability granted by your class because you think a different damage type would be more helpful against undead in an upcoming encounter, talk to your Director.</p>
<h4 id="optional-rule-respite-ability-changes">Optional Rule: Respite Ability Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-rule-respite-ability-changes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An optional rule the Director can include in your game is to allow heroes to change any number of signature and heroic abilities granted by their class as a respite activity (see Respite in Chapter 1: The Basics). This allows heroes to prepare for upcoming encounters and try new builds, but the Director and the players should all be comfortable with constantly juggling and learning new abilities.</p>
<h3 id="heroic-advancement">Heroic Advancement<a class="headerlink" href="#heroic-advancement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Your character's heroic advancement is marked by level. Each time you gain a new level in your class, your Stamina increases, and you gain new features or abilities according to your class's advancement, as detailed in Chapter 5: Classes.</p>
<p>In the standard setup for the game, heroes gain Experience each time they finish a respite (see Building a Heroic Narrative in Chapter 1: The Basics). When you gain sufficient Experience, you gain a level during the same respite. The Heroic Advancement table shows exactly how much Experience (XP) you need to advance from one level to the next. The amount of Experience you gain is cumulative.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-advancement">Alternative Advancement<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-advancement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Though many games might advance using the standard setup for heroic advancement, the Director can decide that their game uses different advancement. Check with your Director about what method of advancement they plan to use.</p>
<h5 id="adjusted-xp-advancement">Adjusted XP Advancement<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusted-xp-advancement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Some Directors prefer that heroes gain new levels faster or slower to suit the pace of their story. The Adjusted XP Advancement table is set up for campaigns where heroes advance at double or half the usual pace. Directors can also create their own customized pace for XP-based advancement.</p>
<h5 id="milestone-advancement">Milestone Advancement<a class="headerlink" href="#milestone-advancement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Rather than tracking XP, some games have the heroes advance in level when they achieve a particular story milestone. For example, when a party defeats the main villain of an adventure and foils their dastardly plot, each hero gains a level for achieving this objective, no matter how many obstacles they faced along the way.</p>
<p>For many Directors using milestone advancement, the end of each adventure within a campaign serves as a milestone for gaining a new level. The Director can share these milestones with the players to encourage them to work toward particular goals, and to engage with the story and world the Director has prepared. For example, in a campaign where the heroes have to face nine evil mages, it makes sense that each time the heroes defeat a mage, they gain a level. The Director should keep milestone goals flexible, though. Defeating a mage could mean stopping them with violence, using negotiation to make them stand down, or anything else that thwarts their evil plans.</p>
<h5 id="director-says-so">Director Says So<a class="headerlink" href="#director-says-so" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Some games don't track XP or goals at all. The heroes simply gain a level whenever the Director decides it's appropriate for the story.</p>

<h1 id="ancestries">Ancestries<a class="headerlink" href="#ancestries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Fantastic peoples inhabit the worlds of <em>Draw Steel</em>. Among them are devils, dwarves, elves, time raiders—and of course humans, whose culture and history dominates many worlds.</p>
<p>Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn't grant you cultural benefits, such as crafting or lore skills, though. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.</p>
<p>In <em>Draw Steel</em>, ancestry describes how you were born. Culture (part of <a href="#page-67-0">Chapter 4: Background</a>) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!</p>
<p>This chapter details twelve ancestries for the game:</p>
<p><strong>Devil:</strong> Devils originated in the Seven Cities of Hell and have a supernatural charisma that helps them persuade others. They are similar in stature to humans, and their skin tones include deep blues, purples, and reds. They sport horns, eyes of all shades (including gold and red), and tails, and some have feathered or leathery wings.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Knight:</strong> Dragon knights are muscled draconic humanoids who stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. The scales covering their reptilian heads, bodies, and tails can be almost any color. All dragon knights have wings, but on only a few are those wings big enough to let them fly.</p>
<p><strong>Dwarf:</strong> Humanoids with stony skin, dwarves have short and stout bodies. Many carve supernatural runes into their flesh, and some have beards made of crystals.</p>
<p><strong>Wode Elf:</strong> Lithe humanoids with finely furred skin in all shades of blue, wode elves have angular features and large, pointed ears akin to a bat's. They possess a supernatural glamor that allows them to blend in with their surroundings when they wish to hide.</p>
<p><strong>High Elf:</strong> Stately and graceful, high elves have tall, willowy bodies, pointed ears, and smoother skin than most other humanoids. Rare metal inlays such as gold, platinum, palladium, and iridium act as organic components within their skin. The truest form of any high elf is hidden from most—sometimes even from themself—thanks to a supernatural glamor that makes them more attractive to others, whatever that might mean to an individual. This glamor transcends physical appearance, also slightly altering a high elf's tone and smell.</p>
<p><strong>Hakaan:</strong> Descended from stone giants, the mighty hakaan stand over 9 feet tall and have well-muscled bodies made of organic stone. They are the largest ancestry in this book!</p>
<p><strong>Human:</strong> Humans are the most numerous people in Orden and many other fantasy worlds! In <em>Draw Steel</em>, humans have all the diversity that our species displays in real life—and they can sense the presence of supernatural energy!</p>
<p><strong>Memonek:</strong> Originating on Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek are a machine people made of metal, marble, glass, and other inorganic materials. Their bodies are lightweight, making them easier to move and letting them fall at slower speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Orc:</strong> Orcs have skin in green tones and stand slightly taller and wider than humans. A supernatural energy they call "the blood fire" flows through their veins, igniting colorful lines in an orc's skin during life-ordeath battles.</p>
<p><strong>Polder:</strong> The smallest of the ancestries in this book, polders stand no taller than 3-1/2 feet. They look like smaller humans, and they have the ability to blend in with the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>Revenant:</strong> No hero starts their life as a revenant. Rather, these undead creatures return to the world of the living because they have dire business that must be finished. A character of any ancestry can become a revenant.</p>
<p><strong>Time Raider:</strong> Travelers of the timescape, the time raiders (or kuran'zoi as they call themselves) have four arms and a single ocular sensor instead of a pair of eyes. Many have innate psionic abilities that make them capable warriors.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-origin-of-species">On the Origin of Species<a class="headerlink" href="#on-the-origin-of-species" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Orden (talked about in Chapter 1: The Basics) is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. "I dunno, a god did it probably."</p>
<p>Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons, all have creator gods—the Elder Gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.</p>
<p>The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent, species petered out after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.</p>
<p>It may be all species were created by gods. That's certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won't ever. There's still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren't evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.</p>
<p>And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.</p>
<p>However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.</p>
<p>In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfired. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral iridoss, known as prismacore, that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually their science and magics produced the omnivok—machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves they stopped their work and gave their creations full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.</p>
<p>Normally, it doesn't work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed 30 years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.</p>
<p>The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.</p>
<p>Usually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent species, it's for less-than-virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran'zoi—the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and who carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.</p>
<p>A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called <em>quickening</em>, used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of <em>uplifting</em> found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn't create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angulotls walking around having conversations with each other,</p>
<p>wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn't get moldy in the swamp.</p>
<p>This also carries serious ethical repercussions! "You didn't create angulotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!"</p>
<p>This is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and replace it with something you made up, it will be better. Because it's <em>yours</em>!</p>
<h3 id="names-by-ancestry">Names by Ancestry<a class="headerlink" href="#names-by-ancestry" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Obviously you're free to invent whatever name you want for your character! And your director might have their own setting that uses different cultures than those in Orden. But if you want to pick an Orden-appropriate name for your hero, keep reading.</p>
<p>Equally obviously; names are cultural, not biological. Your character probably has a name appropriate to whatever culture they were born into, or grew up in. A human raised by hakaan would probably have a hakaan name.</p>
<h4 id="last-names-and-bynames">Last Names and Bynames<a class="headerlink" href="#last-names-and-bynames" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Most people living in Orden—and this is especially true of Vasloria live in villages. They do not have and do not use last names or family names. Everyone in the village knows who you mean when you refer to "William." Even if there's more than one William in the village, you can usually tell who someone's referring to from context. Sometimes folks prepend "our" to someone's name meaning: the one related to or otherwise concerned with me and my family. "Our William" for instance.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, folks use another identifier known as a byname. If there were two boys in the village named Much, one of them might be called Much the Miller's Son, to distinguish them from the other lad.</p>
<p>If you leave your village regularly, say to trade with others in a distant market, then your byname might be the place you're from. Alan from the village in the dale, might become known as Alan from the Dale, or even Alan-a-Dale. But everyone back home just calls you Alan.</p>
<p>A byname might refer to your profession. Clyde the Cartwright is a perfectly normal byname. But no one you met would assume "Cartwright" was your 'family name.' People who live permanently in a very large city like Capital use family names, because almost no first name is sufficiently unique to identify you, and "Marissa the Cartwright's Daughter" quickly evolves into Marissa Cartwright.</p>
<p>Most nobles in Orden also use the name of the area they rule as part of their name. When someone refers to Lord Edmund Bedegar everyone listening silently, without thinking about it, adds "of" between the name and the place. Edmund is both Edmund, and the Lord of Bedegar, and Edmund, Lord of Bedegar, and therefore sometimes Lord Edmund Bedegar. Even though "Bedegar" looks like a "last name" to us, and is being used in that manner sometimes, it's not exactly his last name. It's still just another kind of byname.</p>

<p>Most cultures in Vasloria make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, though not all do. And for some cultures that make such a distinction, almost no one outside the culture can tell the difference.</p>
<p>Among those cultures which do make a distinction between masculine and feminine names, there are always names that <em>could</em> refer to a person of any gender. Here in the real world, you can't tell a person's gender just from the name "Shane." This is mostly because which names are considered masculine or feminine changes over time, and when this happens, there's a period—maybe a few generations—where the name could refer to a person of any gender.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no law (neither metaphorically nor literally) that requires your character to go by their birth name. They might not even know their birth name depending on what happened after they were born. It's not unusual, especially among talents, for a hero to adopt a moniker or sobriquet instead of a name. And in some cultures, there's a tradition of changing your name—or at least how you prefer to be known—as you go through different stages of life. High elves sometimes adopt a wholly new name when they reach a certain age, or more commonly, they choose a different component of their name. When A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers was a young woman, she was known as Mist. Now that she's the master of the Tower of Translation, she's known as Embers.</p>
<h4 id="authentic-or-comedic">Authentic or Comedic?<a class="headerlink" href="#authentic-or-comedic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>For some players choosing a "good name"—by which they mean "authentic to the setting"—is important and can take a while. Because the right name can ground a character in the world, and this can help the player feel more immersed in the fictional reality. It also communicates to the other players that you're serious about the game and your hero.</p>
<p>For other players, choosing a comedic, joke name communicates the opposite! You are here to have fun and screw around and taking things seriously is something you already have to do all week, and so you pick a ridiculous name just to get a laugh because that's what you're serious about.</p>
<p>The choice of name is an important one, because it says a lot about you and how you view the game as a whole.</p>

<p>Elves in general have a casual attitude toward gender, it having no direct bearing on procreation for them. (Normal elf upon learning how humans mate: "You mean … like animals?") They tend to view the various sex-linked traits associated among other ancestries with masculinity or femininity as a kind of fashion to be taken up or discarded as the mood suits. Over one life, any elf might wear masculine features, or feminine features, or both, many times. For wode elves, this often means adopting a new name, or a different version of the same name. Llyandros might become Llyandra for instance.</p>

<p>Each ancestry has one or more signature traits, which your hero gets for free if they take that ancestry. This is a defining feature that other heroes of your ancestry also possess.</p>
<p>Ancestries also have purchased traits, but you don't get every purchased trait your ancestry has to offer. Instead, your ancestry provides a budget of ancestry points you can use to select traits. Each trait has a point cost that you pay to grant its benefit to your hero.</p>
<p>For example, the devil ancestry has the signature trait Silver Tongue and 3 ancestry points to spend on seven different traits. A player creating a devil hero could select Barbed Tail, Glowing Eyes, and Hellsight, each of which costs 1 ancestry point, or they could select one of those traits plus Impressive Horns or Wings, each of which costs 2 ancestry points. But they couldn't select both Impressive Horns and Wings, since their combined cost of 4 exceeds the ancestry points budget for the devil.</p>
<h2 id="devil">Devil<a class="headerlink" href="#devil" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The native ancestry of the Seven Cities of Hell, devils are humanoids with red or blue skin expressed in a wide variety of hues, from bright crimson to deep purple. Each devil is born with some <em>hellmark</em>—horns, a tail, cloven hooves, a forked tongue, fanged incisors, or even wings.</p>
<p>Hell is dominated by the Seven Cities of Hell, each ruled by a different archdevil who constantly plots and schemes against the others in the hope of ascending to the Throne of Hell.</p>
<p>Those devils who join "the trade," as their civil service is called, spend their days in bureaucratic service hoping or scheming for promotion. Devils looking for a quick path up the bureaucratic ladder sign up for the Exchange, whereby mortals in the mundane world who perform the right rituals can summon a devil, who bargains with the supplicant on behalf of their archdevil. Archdevils can grant temporary worldly power in exchange for a supplicant's soul, with the summoned devil acting as the broker.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, though, the summoning goes wrong and the supplicant dies before the deal can be struck, stranding the summoned devil on Orden permanently. Some stranded devils seek to return to Hell, but most prefer life in Orden, where the phrase "stabbed in the back by a colleague" is usually a metaphor.</p>
<p>The majority of devils in Orden are not from, nor have ever been to, the Seven Cities. They are descendants of devils who were stranded in the mundane world decades, centuries, even millennia ago.</p>

<p>Adelard scuttled across the floor of his basement, a heavy tome clutched in one hand, his index finger marking a page. Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a diagram, look at the chalk markings he'd made on the floor, tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an esoteric symbol.</p>
<p>One of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the small room noticeably darker. "Damn and blast!" he hissed. Then he relit it from another candle.</p>
<p>Stepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He'd spent his last coppers on the candles—they weren't cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said <em>a</em> skull—it didn't even specify a <em>human</em> skull! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual <em>know</em> if the skull was real?</p>
<p>He was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help. He opened the book and turned the page—then began to speak the ritual.</p>
<p>Moments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared … there was a devil standing in his basement—dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.</p>
<p>"Aha! Yes, finally." The creature rubbed his hands together. "It's about time," he said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. "Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes." He cleared his throat. "On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you …" But his speech fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>"It worked!" Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. "Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after <em>years</em>! I will have my revenge! Hahaha …! *cough* *cough*" Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing.</p>
<p>"Dismiss me from service, will they?! *cough* Old and useless … am I?! I'll show <em>them</em>!" He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. "I will <em>hex</em> them and <em>torture</em> them until they …"</p>
<p>He stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. "Until they … until …" He clutched his chest.</p>
<p>"Uh-oh," the devil said, genuinely worried.</p>
<p>"HNNG!" Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.</p>
<p>"Nono. Nurse!" the devil called out. "Doctor?! Is anyone … you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some … some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always …"</p>
<p>Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.</p>
<p>"… calms me down," the devil said quietly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch blackness. The devil's hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. "Um," he said to the empty room. "Uh-oh."</p>
<p>He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.</p>
<p>He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack, on the outskirts of a small village opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.</p>
<p>"Ah," the devil said.</p>
<p>A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.</p>
<p>"Oh! Good day to you, madam. I wonder if you could tell me …"</p>
<p>"AAAHHHHH!!!" she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.</p>
<p>"Ah. Um. Hmm."</p>
<p>A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.</p>
<p>"Have at you, devil!" he said, assuming something like a dueling pose. "I say! Steady on!" The devil raised his hands.</p>
<p>The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.</p>
<p>Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>• "And that's how I ended up here!" Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. "Now, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!"</p>
<p>"Legendarily <em>vain</em>," his dinner guest teased with a smile.</p>
<p>"Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don't they?"</p>
<p>She laughed. "Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as advertised."</p>
<p>"Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady."</p>
<p>"Not all actors are vain." She took offense beautifully. "Just the good ones." She sipped her drink.</p>
<p>"Well then, you must be very vain indeed," the devil said. "Anyway, does that answer your question?"</p>
<p>"Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in Hell?"</p>
<p>"<em>What</em> a good question. Unless it's <em>very</em> old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I'm sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that."</p>
<p>"No cloud of brimstone now?" she teased.</p>
<p>He waggled his eyebrows. "Style counts for something."</p>
<p>"But wait, that was …" She did some quick mental math. "Fifteen years ago?"</p>
<p>"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between." "An accountant!"</p>
<p>Riyalkin shrugged. "It's what I did before. I'm moderately good at it." "And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?"</p>
<p>"Well …" Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. "It's just that … the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body. And I guess I just … missed the excitement."</p>
<p>"The excitement of being an accountant."</p>
<p>"The excitement of being an accountant <em>in Hell</em>," Riyalkin said. "In any event, enough about me and the thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste</p>
<p>and the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel <em>underdressed</em> in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is it that any outfit is improved by your <em>unearthly</em> beauty?"</p>

<h2 id="dragon-knight">Dragon Knight<a class="headerlink" href="#dragon-knight" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The ritual of Dracogenesis that grants the power to create a generation of dragon knights—also known as draconians or wyrmwights—is obscure and supremely difficult for even an experienced sorcerer to master. Small populations of draconians in Khemhara, Higara, and Khoursir attest to this. Descendants of original generations created millennia ago by powerful wizards, they have never been numerous. A typical clutch yields only a single egg. After only a few generations, these draconians begin to show new adaptations like feathers or frilled ridges.</p>
<p>The largest extant population of draconians is the remnants of the Dragon Phalanx in Vasloria. Created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae, the Dragon Phalanx once numbered several thousand of the king's greatest knights, ensuring the rule of law across the land.</p>
<p>Knighthood was a title carried by every member of that first generation of dragon knights. Within the Dragon Phalanx were shadows, censors, tacticians, and elementalists. Members of virtually every heroic vocation could be found in one of the eight dragonflights that made up the phalanx. For over 30 years, these heroes were symbols of justice, protecting the weak from the strong, and standing between the common folk and those who sought power over others. Those who grew up in that place and time could not imagine any other way of life.</p>

<p>A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.</p>

<p>Looking at the dragon knight, another bandit added quickly, "We didn't know there was one of you here."</p>
<p>The draconian didn't move. Didn't give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf. "Think of the <em>bounty</em>," the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. "We'll all be <em>rich</em>."</p>
<p>The two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren't afraid anymore.</p>
<p>"We'll be <em>back</em>," the lead dwarf said, and the group of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.</p>
<p>As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. "Show's over," he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.</p>
<p>A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. "Excuse me, sir knight," the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.</p>
<p>The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.</p>
<p>The man touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed. "Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin' for you."</p>
<p>The dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. "<em>Look for someone else</em>," he growled as he pulled his arm away.</p>
<p>The man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. "I'm sorry sir, but there ain't no one else. There's this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he's of Saint Ajax."</p>
<p>The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away—when someone else spoke.</p>
<p>"You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant," said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.</p>
<p>The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who'd spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.</p>
<p>"John?"</p>
<p>The man turned to look up.</p>
<p>"Hi Vaant," he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middleaged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons. "Folks," he said, "this is Vaantikalisax, knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights."</p>
<p>The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. "What are you doing out here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"These people need help. I said I'd find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn."</p>
<p>The draconian sniffed, released John's hand. "Sure," he said. "But why <em>me</em>?"</p>
<p>"Thought maybe you'd like to get back in the game."</p>
<p>"The game."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Sir John smiled. "The hero game."</p>
<p>The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.</p>
<p>"I owe you a lot, John—but not everything."</p>
<p>"I'm not asking everything."</p>
<p>"No, that's not how it starts. But I have this feeling that's how it'll end."</p>
<p>"What does your oath say? 'Even should the sun stop in the sky, even should the night—'"</p>
<p>"John," the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad. Exasperated. "You don't want to quote my oath to me. You really don't. I liked serving with you. I have fond memories of that time—of you. Don't spoil it." He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.</p>
<p>"Vaant," Sir John said, following. "Sir Vaantikalisax, by your <em>oath</em>!" The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.</p>
<p>"The people need leadership," John said.</p>
<p>Vaantikalisax's reptile eyes flashed in anger. "They <em>had it</em>! Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax … I watched him …" The dragon knight's eyes flinched. His clawed hands tightened on his mace and shield. "I watched the oath … fail."</p>
<p>"Vaant … Vaant, the Dragon Phalanx didn't <em>fail</em>. You were <em>betrayed</em>. It was Mandrake! One of your own, don't you get it? You're just as fallible as the rest of us. You were never 'incorruptible.' It's just what we wanted to believe. You're just people—like the rest of us."</p>
<p>The dragon knight looked at the people around him, at the three peasants desperate for someone, anyone, to help them. Then he looked back to his friend.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Vaantikalisax said. Then he turned and left the inn.</p>

<p>Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than other humanoids. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.</p>
<p>Dwarves are the children of the elder god Ord, and a common phrase among dwarves is "Ord made the world"—their way of saying, "What will be, will be." They take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord's name.</p>

<p>"They can be stubborn," Embers said.</p>
<p>John smiled and gave her a look as they walked around the barn. "Yeah not like elves and humans, right?"</p>
<p>Embers grinned.</p>
<p>"They're good in a fight," John said, and his tone implied this was all that mattered. "They're natural commanders."</p>
<p>"Yes I can imagine why," Embers said. "Each sentence sounds like an order."</p>
<p>They found the dwarf at the edge of the old quarry outside of town cutting blocks of stone with a long copper saw. It normally took two people a quarter hour, but the dwarf sawed an entire block in two with a single stroke. The stones smoked as they fell, and the copper saw glowed with heat.</p>
<p>John and Embers watched silently as the dwarf hefted another massive stone onto the cutting block.</p>
<p>The dwarf spit into his hands and noticed the two out of the corner of his eye. He paused, walked over to grab his battle staff with the hourglass symbol of Zarok, Law-Giver at the tip. He walked back to the stone and leaned his staff against a tree stump within easy reach should he need to use it.</p>
<p>He went back to work.</p>
<p>"Good morning," John said.</p>
<p>The dwarf ignored them.</p>
<p>"I'm a friend of Morag the Wise Woman," John said. "She said there was a high theochron of Zarok, Law-Giver around here working to earn his keep."</p>
<p>The dwarf paused. "High theochron?" he said. "A lofty title. Far too lofty for a job such as this," he went back to work and a moment later there were two more smoking blocks. He cleared them away.</p>
<p>"There's a job for nine …" John hesitated. <em>Ratcatchers</em> didn't seem appropriate. He went with his gut. "Heroes. In Bedegar. A village looking for someone to stand against Lord Saxton."</p>
<p>"Mm. I have heard of this one," the dwarf said, seemingly uninterested. He hurled the smaller blocks into a pile and went to heft a new stone to cut. "A foul tyrant. Well-suited to these times. Perhaps the people deserve him."</p>
<p>"No people <em>deserve</em> tyranny," Embers said, an edge in her voice. The dwarf appeared to notice her for the first time, peered at her, took in her raiment, and went back to work. "Nine against Saxton." The dwarf carried the massive block over his head to the cutting stone. He shook his head in disbelief at what was being asked. "How great the opposition?"</p>
<p>John told him.</p>
<p>The dwarf dropped the stone in astonishment and stared at the human and elf. Then he smiled. "Hah. You know our traditions well, sir knight. You seek to grant me a glorious death leading desperate soldiers against impossible odds."</p>
<p>"Not that desperate," John said modestly.</p>
<p>"Yes." The dwarf looked at Embers again. "By garb and reputation, I make you A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers, mistress of the Tower of Translation. You are no stranger to power. But your tower is fallen lady," he said. "Seek you revenge? Or justice?"</p>
<p>"I see no reason to choose," Embers said smoothly. "In my case, as well as the case of these villagers, justice would <em>be</em> revenge."</p>
<p>The dwarf's head snapped to look at Sir John. "She speaks my language as well it seems. You are of a kind, you two."</p>
<p>"Three," John dared.</p>
<p>The dwarf failed to stifle a smile. "And what is your stake in this?" John shrugged. "I've already been paid," he said. He fished around in a pouch on his belt. "Here, I'll split it with you, fair and square."</p>
<p>John flicked a coin off his finger with his thumb. It spun and glinted as it arced across the space between them. The dwarf snatched it from the air, opened his palm and stared at it. Something in his face changed. Softened. He looked at the nearby town that had adopted him. Peasants doing labor in the fields.</p>
<p>He clenched his fist around the coin. "A princely sum," he said, mostly to himself.</p>
<p>"You are Dazar," Embers dared. "High theochron in exile. Yours is the greatest dwarven church in all Omund's Land. Thousands look to you for spiritual guidance."</p>
<p>The dwarf said nothing. He looked at the coin in his hand.</p>
<p>"You left your people," Embers said quietly.</p>
<p>"My people left me!" Dazar barked. "When they embraced Ajax!" Embers just watched the dwarf. His rage subsided as quickly as it came.</p>
<p>"I thought … I thought leaving might inspire my people to …" He looked at the nearby village. "Eh, it matters not. I could not have stayed in any event. I lack the stomach for tyranny."</p>
<p>"Kal Kalavar's new thane is not an easy problem to solve," John said with sympathy. "Saxton is."</p>
<p>The dwarf looked up at Embers, "Her I know by reputation." He turned to look at John.</p>
<p>John bowed slightly. "John," he said.</p>
<p>Dazar looked at his armor, the age and weather of it, and made an intuitive leap. "You served under the Good King."</p>
<p>John pursed his lips. "That was a long time ago."</p>
<p>Dazar shook his head once. "Not to me." He picked up his battlestaff and stepped forward. "I knew him, you see. Omund was a fine king. The best we'll see even in a life as long as mine."</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment. "These people," Dazar said. "These villagers. Do they know what they ask?"</p>
<p>John didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Do they know that asking us for help, asking <em>you</em>," Dazar looked Sir John up and down "… means starting something they <em>must</em> see through to the end? It means hardship, privation, <em>death</em> buying a future for their children? You told them this?"</p>
<p>John shook his head.</p>
<p>"Well why not?!" Dazar demanded. "You of all people must understand …"</p>
<p>"Dazar," John said, and his measured voice was a quick counter to Dazar's protest. "These people are already at their wits' end. Just … just surviving, putting food on the table, keeping their children warm. Giving them <em>hope</em>. It's already more than should be asked of anyone. And then coming to us, swallowing their pride. Asking us for aid.</p>
<p>"It's our job to understand the job <em>for</em> them." Then, quieter, John added, "And forgive them, ahead of time, for when they weaken, and give in to fear."</p>
<p>Dazar stared at the man, this knight of Tor, and looked at Embers quietly radiating pride in her friend.</p>
<p>"Hmm," Dazar grunted. He opened a pouch on his chest armor and inserted the coin. "We must find a troubadour, to tell the tale of Saxton's fall. I cannot wait to hear how it ends!" He walked between them, carrying his staff over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Come!" he barked. "There's a world needs mending! Why stand we here idle?"</p>
<p>John was grinning madly at Embers. She held up three fingers.</p>

<h2 id="wode-elf">Wode Elf<a class="headerlink" href="#wode-elf" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Children of the sylvan celestials and masters of the elf-haunted forests called wodes, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans <em>should</em> fear the trees.</p>
<p>The wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence, called <em>glamor</em>, complements their guerilla style of fighting, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make the relatively few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.</p>
<h3 id="on-wode-elves">On Wode Elves<a class="headerlink" href="#on-wode-elves" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>"I'm scared," Wenna said. "We should go back." The forest felt as if it was closing in on them.</p>
<p>"We're not going back," Jeremy said. Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.</p>
<p>"What if we're going in circles?"</p>
<p>"Then we <em>keep</em> going in circles!" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. "Until we find the elves."</p>
<p>"The elves have found <em>you</em>!" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.</p>
<p>Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.</p>
<p>Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.</p>
<p>The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.</p>
<p>"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience." The voice they had heard called out again—from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They wore a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.</p>
<p>"<em>Consort!</em>" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. "<em>We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.</em>"</p>
<p>Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. "They called that one 'consort!'"</p>
<p>Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a <em>See? I told you!</em> look on their face.</p>
<p>The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. "I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr." They indicated the elf who had spoken. "This is my cousin, Rhythylthin."</p>
<p>"How did you know we were here?" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.</p>
<p>The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.</p>
<p>"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge," the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. "And approval," Rhythylthin added, clenching his fist and snapping the arrow in it.</p>
<p>"You come bearing a gift for our queen—the <em>Codex Dryadalis</em>." Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. "My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter."</p>
<p>The elf smiled at the children. "But have no fear," they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a melody. "You are safe … now." The pause before "now" spoke volumes.</p>
<p>"Are you a … a … boy or a girl?" Wenna asked.</p>
<p>Llyander smiled gaily. "I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike," they said. Wenna smiled.</p>
<p>Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. "Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends." They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. "Me? I'm old fashioned." They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. "<em>Grace</em> never goes out of style."</p>
<p>Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. "Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them." Then, suddenly imperious, they added, "You may go."</p>
<p>In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.</p>
<p>"How did they <em>do</em> that?" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.</p>
<p>"Hmm? Do what?" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.</p>
<p>"Just … disappear like that!"</p>
<p>Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. "Do terran children not play hiding games?"</p>
<p>"Well …" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. "We do, but …"</p>
<p>Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. "Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it."</p>
<p>"But that was …" Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. "That was <em>magic</em>!"</p>
<p>"You say? Well," Llyander mused, "terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!" The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.</p>
<p>Llyander turned and marched off. "Come!" they called. The children ran to catch up.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Wenna asked.</p>
<p>"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear," Llyander said. "We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well—likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure." They smiled.</p>
<p>The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.</p>
<p>"I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax."</p>
<p>The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.</p>
<p>Jeremy turned to Dade. "I feel like we're in a dream," he whispered. "You are!" their escort called out. "The wode is a dream! With a little luck, one you may soon wake safely from."</p>

<p>Children of the solar celestials created to tend their libraries and attend to the true elves as heralds, high elf history describes a better age, before the coming of humans and war. A time when the celestials were still in the world, and all that mattered was art and beauty.</p>
<p>In the millennia since their creators retired to Arcadia, the high elves built a civilization for themselves, primarily living in and among the fallen celestial sky cities. With no creators left to please, the elves continue as they did before—collecting lore and knowledge, worshipping art, and turning more inward and distrusting of outsiders with each generation.</p>

<p>"They're so beautiful," Wenna said. "It's hard to imagine we're in danger."</p>
<p>"It's not that hard," Dade said darkly.</p>
<p>The five children stood alone in the center of a large circular courtyard open to the sky, their wode elf escort Llyander at their side. Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the <em>Codex Dryadalis</em> in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter.</p>
<p>"They seem like …" Meliora said, searching for the words.</p>
<p>"Like the lords of all the world," Wenna said with awe and wonder. "And we are their prisoners," Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.</p>
<p>"You're not prisoners," Llyander said quietly. "You are guests. You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes."</p>
<p>"Yes," Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. "We feel very safe."</p>
<p>"Who are you kidding?" Dade said. "Everyone knows how much elves hate humans."</p>
<p>At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.</p>
<p>"Show me an elf who hates humans," he said, his voice deep and sonorous, "and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die." He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. "Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us."</p>
<p>The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.</p>
<p>"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it …"—he looked at Llyander—"… by changing my mind."</p>
<p>Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.</p>
<p>"Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught." Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. "But this is not nothing," he said. "We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my grandmother's grandmother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty."</p>
<p>Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. "Well, you see children?" Llyander said. "We only have <em>more</em> to do, not everything to do."</p>
<p>The king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, "Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew on a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!"</p>
<p>Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.</p>
<p>"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.</p>
<p>"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my ancient relative labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves." He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.</p>
<p>"He seems wise," Credan said.</p>
<p>"And smart," Meliora said.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised how kind he is," Jeremy said. "He seems a good king." Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually she couldn't resist. "What?"</p>
<p>Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.</p>
<p>"Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?" they said, their voice low. "How astonished you were?"</p>
<p>Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. "This is <em>their</em> glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of <em>demeanor</em>."</p>
<p>"But how do they <em>do</em> …"</p>
<p>Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. "It is not a thing they <em>do</em>. It is an effect in your <em>mind</em>."</p>
<p>"You mean they don't even know they're doing it?" Meliora asked.</p>
<p>"Then what do they really look like?" Wenna asked.</p>
<p>Llyander shrugged. "What does anyone really look like?" And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.</p>
<p>The king turned back to them. "Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee <em>elf friend</em>. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands."</p>
<p>Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. "Not bad for your second quest. What shall you do for an encore?"</p>

<h2 id="hakaan">Hakaan<a class="headerlink" href="#hakaan" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In spite of their friendly, outgoing nature, the rare presence of a hakaan in human society is considered a harbinger. An omen of dark times.</p>
<p>Descended from a tribe of giants in upper Vanigar, the original Haka'an tribe made a bargain with Holkatya the Vanigar trickster god. They traded some of their gigantic size and strength for the ability to see the future.</p>
<p>But Holkatya betrayed them, and the only future a hakaan is allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death. These visions are never of some mundane tragedy. No hakaan ever received a vision of dying from choking on a grape. This Doomsight is always momentous. Always dramatic.</p>
<p>The Doomsight can happen at any moment. It does not come for all or even most hakaan, but when it comes, it is considered an act of overwhelming hubris to ignore it. Trying to escape the Doomsight means a painful, tragic death, and cursing your family to live with shame.</p>
<p>But the only hakaan the average human meets is one trying to fulfill their doom. The human superstition—that the arrival of one or more hakaan in human lands is a sign of great forces acting in the world, auspicious times—is literally true. In dark times, many hakaan experience the Doomsight and leave their communities to venture out into the mundane world, in search of their destiny.</p>
<p>Humans in Vanigar have their own word for this concept of a personal fate. "Wyrd." Traditional hakaan sometimes refer to the Doomsight as "wyrdken."</p>

<p>The gate, or door, or whatever it was started to close. With Dazar on the other side of it.</p>
<p>"Embers!" John called out, but the high elf was surrounded. At that moment, a detonation. An explosion of sound that knocked the demons back. And a giant stood before the lumbering egress.</p>
<p>Dust settled on the ground behind the giant, and John realized the thunderclap was the sound of the giant running to them. Air that couldn't get out of the way fast enough, tortured by the pressure of his speed.</p>
<p>The rectangular, toothed egress demon was twelve feet tall at least, the giant almost matching its immense size.</p>
<p>In the instant before the maw of teeth and eyeballs shut, the giant grabbed each side of the mouth, and pulled. Muscles the size of hounds bulged. Tendons like ship cables stood taught, quivering with strain. "Not today!" the giant shouted. "Not TODAY!!"</p>
<p>As the giant forced the maw open, glowing tentacles writhed out of it, wrapping around the giant's arms, legs, neck. "Hahah!" the figure laughed. "You'll find … MY flesh …" the giant's bravado hid the fact that he was at the uttermost limits of his strength. "… too RICH … for your taste!"</p>
<p>John knew what the giant did not—the tendrils drained life, sapped energy. The living portal would gain the strength it needed to defeat the giant by drinking his own life force.</p>
<p>But the arrival of the giant changed the equation. John saw a new solution. The hakaan risked his life to buy them options, and Sir John of Tor would not let the giant risk his life in vain.</p>
<p>Kicking the styrich back gave John room to move, and he dashed toward Embers. A shout, and a thrust into the soulraker's back, and the demons surrounding Embers turned to face Sir John.</p>
<p>He had to focus so intently on the demons who now surrounded him, he wasn't even sure Embers knew what to do. But he needn't have worried. When he risked a glance, she was already gone. A light fall of starstuff the only evidence she had translated into void.</p>
<p>Dispatching a chimeron, John saw Embers emerge from the other side of the egress demon with Dazar in her arms. John couldn't tell if Dazar was conscious. He might even be dead. Who knew what lurked on the other side of that living portal to the Abyssal Waste?</p>
<p>The hakaan struggled against the living gateway to that blasted world. One leg buckled and the stone warrior fell to one knee. The door would take him just as it took their dwarf conduit.</p>
<p>Then, rising behind the egress demon, the high theocron, his battlestaff glowing.</p>
<p>"Back!" Dazar conduit of Zarok, Law-Giver shouted, smashing at the flesh of the living doorway with his battlestaff. "To hell!" He swung again.</p>
<p>The doorway quivered and bled, and the giant stood up. "Yes!" He called out. "YES!"</p>
<p>John and Embers joined the fight. The gamble, unspoken, was that the summoned demons would evaporate if their living portal were destroyed. It paid off.</p>
<p>They only had a moment before the demons swarmed them, but a moment was all it took before the hakaan shouted and finally ripped the bloody egress demon apart with his bare hands.</p>
<p>The demons in midstride all turned inside out, leaving bubbling, steaming pools of organs, eyeballs, and teeth on the ground. Leaving four heroes gasping from the fight.</p>
<p>"I told you …" Dazar said, hands on his knees. "Not to open! That book!"</p>
<p>"You didn't say 'Don't open that,'" John said, leaning back and gulping air. "You just said it was dangerous. I knew it was dangerous!"</p>
<p>"Well met!" The giant laughed at the two friends squabbling.</p>
<p>"Well met indeed," Sir John said getting his breathing under control as the group gathered before the giant. "Thank you for rescuing my friend."</p>
<p>"I had the situation under control," Dazar muttered, all evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>"Of a surety!" The giant's humor matched his size. "It was my honor to grant thee aid, nothing more."</p>
<p>"You've been following us for a while," Embers said. John wondered what she meant.</p>
<p>"From the beginning," the giant said enigmatically.</p>
<p>"Don't take this the wrong way," John confessed, "but I was afraid we'd meet a barrow-man on this journey."</p>
<p>The giant smiled "Fear? At a meeting of friends? Ah these must be treacherous times indeed if simple folk like us have cause to fear meeting strangers."</p>
<p>"No offense," John said. "It's just that … well … we only ever see one of you when you come down from the hills. Following your doom. Which is usually a …" John tried to find a less dramatic way to say it, but nothing came to mind. "A tiding of ill-omen."</p>
<p>"You are following your wyrd," Embers said.</p>
<p>The giant shook his head. "Following my brother. He hurtles headlong to meet his doom, which I deem is bound up in this matter of this Sky Tyrant."</p>
<p>"Ajax," Dazar said. And the hakaan could hear the darkness in his voice.</p>
<p>"Aye. I did not understand why his path and yours seemed coincident, but now I think it has something to do with the thing they all seek, his demons."</p>
<p>John looked at Embers. "One of the Eleven Who Shall Not Be Named," she said. "The fifth, I suspect. They were the elite deathless servants of the Lord of Swords who once ruled this land, many ages ago. Ajax is collecting the artifacts of ancient emperors. And their servants too, it seems."</p>
<p>The giant nodded solemnly. "You are lorewise. My trust in you was well-placed. I am Ardashir," he placed one palm on his forehead, the other over his heart, and bowed his head once. "It would be my pleasure to journey with you awhile. Stalwart allies are rare and precious in these times." He grinned. "Good company even more so."</p>
<p>"No armor, no sword or staff," Dazar noticed. "Hakaan do not use weapons?"</p>
<p>"Many do!" Ardashir said. "I do not. I left the hills of my people long ago to pursue a different path. A path of order and discipline. It is my birthright perhaps."</p>
<p>"He's a null," Embers explained. "They eschew all weapons and implements of war. It is part of their creed, as I understand it."</p>
<p>"Strength alone might serve," Dazar nodded, "when the strength is such as yours."</p>
<p>Ardashir grinned. "Strength alone is not enough." He assumed a fighting pose, hands clenched, arms in a guarding position before him. "Discipline, training, focus. These are my implements."</p>
<p>"Well you can't ever be disarmed," John said. "That could be useful." Ardashir's smile was brilliant. "I suffice," he said.</p>

<p>Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will die. When that encounter begins, you become doomed. While doomed, you automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on tests and ability rolls, and you don't die no matter how low your Stamina falls. You then die immediately at the end of the encounter, and can't be returned to life by any means.</p>
<p>If you don't predetermine your death encounter, you can choose to become doomed while you are dying with the Director's approval (no action required). Doing so should be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a result of suitable heroism, such as making a last stand against a boss or saving civilians, or when the consequences of your actions have finally caught up to you—not because you're playing a one-shot and have nothing to lose, Hacaarl.</p>
<p>Additionally, when your Stamina reaches the negative of your winded value and you are not doomed, you turn to rubble instead of experiencing death. You are unaware of your surroundings in this state, and you can't regain Stamina or have this effect undone in any way. After 12 hours, you regain Stamina equal to your recovery value.</p>

<p>So, we arrive here at the end of your first semester of Human Culture. I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students' names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.</p>
<p>I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class. What do I think of humans?</p>
<p>I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, for thirteen centuries. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.</p>
<p>What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.</p>
<p>I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Chaos 373. The fire <em>leveled this city</em>. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?</p>
<p><em>Six months</em> after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt … everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.</p>
<p>Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short—almost as soon as you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.</p>
<p>That refusal to yield to death … to <em>death</em> … is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.</p>
<p>We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last—more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.</p>
<p>Today, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but we learned of many great evils that plagued this world. We met the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, as he opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.</p>
<p>We watched Cthrion Uroniziir try to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.1</p>
<p>Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them—all of them—were led … by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.</p>
<p>Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think … there must be.</p>
<p>Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not <em>weigh</em> different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world … for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice … I can scarcely imagine.</p>
<p>The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you—normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.</p>
<p>Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely now, but the future has a way of surprising us.</p>
<p>Some of your names, I will see written in future textbooks. But some of your names, I will see written in the stars.</p>

<p>The native denizens of Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek dwell in a land with lakes and trees and birds and flowers. But on this alien world, the lakes are seas of mercury, the birds glitter with wings of glass stretched gossamer thin, and the flowers' petals are iridescent metal as flexible and fragile as any earthly rose.</p>
<p>The minds of memonek are highly ordered. Their reason is their great pride. But when descending to the lower planes, including a manifold like Orden where law and chaos mix, a sickness comes over them—an uncontrollable sensation called emotion.</p>

<p>"You want to tell me what just happened?" Sir John asked. Count Revile avoided his gaze, then turned and stamped across the bloody battlefield. "I'm fine!" Revile shouted, all evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>"I know what I saw," John said as he followed his friend. "You went into a <em>bloodlust</em>. And it's not the first time. Listen!" John shouted, uncharacteristically, trying to get the count to pay attention. "You <em>asked</em> me for help, remember? You want to get home," John gestured to the sky, "… and you asked for help and I <em>said</em>, 'Do you remember?' I said, '<em>Is there anything else we should know?</em>'</p>
<p>"Now I <em>meant</em>, 'Is there anyone coming after you we need to know about?' But it's starting to <em>seem like</em> there's something wrong with <em>you</em>. That you <em>knew about</em> and <em>chose</em> not to tell me."</p>
<p>Vithyaranu, Count of the ALAV <em>Revile</em> paced back and forth, his cloak billowing. John continued.</p>
<p>"Listen, whether you like it or not, whether I like it or not, I'm in charge of this mission. Either you tell me what's going on, or I have no choice. I <em>have</em> to conclude you're a danger to the team and cut you loose."</p>
<p>Revile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek's white porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it was brittle, fragile.</p>
<p>Count Revile took a deep breath. "We call it <em>velloparatha</em>," he said. "In your tongue it would be … worldsick. Or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens … to my people … when they come to your world. It is an illness of … of feeling. Emotion."</p>
<p>"Are you going mad?" John asked, his voice quiet. He wanted to give the count a chance to answer privately.</p>
<p>The memonek smiled ruefully. "It feels that way sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an insect that landed on my finger. A <em>grasshopper</em> the dwarf called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect and beautiful. That was awe. As powerful as I have ever felt. In the battle today, anger. Just as powerful.</p>
<p>"I thought I could resist it. When I arrived here and felt no different I thought perhaps worldsickness was a legend. But it is a slow process, this illness. These insidious emotions."</p>
<p>"No emotions where you're from?"</p>
<p>Count Revile shook his head. "Not like this. We are creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our pride. Our religion sometimes methinks. We have emotions; joy, sadness, wonder, grief. But they are … a fashion. They do not <em>happen</em> to us; they are something we indulge in, out of propriety. Here … everything is order and chaos mixed. Even in <em>me</em>. In me." Revile placed his hand on his chest.</p>
<p>"In the battle today. That anger was not directed at Ajax's war dogs. It was at myself."</p>
<p>"At yourself ? Why? What did you …?"</p>
<p>"John," the memonek said, and now it was his turn to whisper. "I was afraid. Afraid of … of being wounded, of failing you, failing my friends. Of dying. And out of that fear came … enormous anger. At myself. Anger that I was so weak so … useless. Anger so … strong, so powerful … I forgot who I was."</p>
<p>John chuckled. "That's just …" He smiled broadly. "That's just normal. We all feel that way."</p>
<p>"What? No, you don't understand …"</p>
<p>"Oh I don't understand, okay, let me guess. It felt like you were gonna <em>piss</em> yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes!!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, happens to all of us."</p>
<p>"Even you?!"</p>
<p>Sir John shrugged. "Are you kidding? Sure. But it doesn't help. You still got a job to do. In fact I'd say that <em>is</em> the job. Anyone can learn the blade." He placed his hand on the pommel of his sword. "Nothing special about that. It's learning to deal with the <em>fear</em>. That's the job. What separates the professionals from the amateurs."</p>
<p>Count Revile said nothing, just thought.</p>
<p>"Feeling better?"</p>
<p>Revile nodded. "I always recover afterwards. But these outbursts come unbidden. Like thunder from a clear sky."</p>
<p>"Hm. Yeah. Well that explains what happened when you met Embers."</p>
<p>Count Revile did not like being reminded of that. He looked to the sky and shook his head. "I made a fool of myself."</p>
<p>"Don't be so hard on yourself. If you're trying to seduce our void mage you made a good start of it. She's three hundred years old. I've known her since I was fifteen. I don't think I've ever seen her <em>blush</em>. Anyway, now that I know what's going on, now that I know you're basically a giant teenager with overactive glands, I can relax a little."</p>
<p>Embers approached and handed John a small, heavy object. She looked at the two men then walked away.</p>
<p>"She was right," John said looking at the iridoss starcore. "They didn't know what it was, but they sure as hell didn't want us to get it.</p>
<p>"Here," John said, handing the engine over to Count Revile. "I guess you're free to go."</p>
<p>Revile looked at the elaborate cage of brass and glass holding a swirling blue starfield. "I guess I am," he said. He looked at Sir John. "I didn't expect our friendship to be so short."</p>
<p>John smiled and maybe blushed a little. "Well," he said looking at the rest of the crew, "being one of my friends these days is a hazardous profession."</p>
<p>The count just got more serious. "I was lucky to meet one such as you on this world."</p>
<p>John shrugged. "Only world I've ever known."</p>
<p>Count Revile hefted the starcore. "I have responsibilities to keep. I will return home and this place will be only a memory." The count was openly sad. "And you can forget about the alien you rescued and his ship of glass and steel."</p>
<p>"Oh, I doubt that," John said. "But I'll tell you this. I'll never look at the stars the same way again."</p>
<p>John offered his hand. Revile shook it and then held it.</p>
<p>"If there are many like you in this world of gods and sorcery," the noble memonek star captain said, "then your victory over evil is assured."</p>
<p>"I don't know about many," John said, extricating his hand. He looked at the dwarf, elf, and hakaan.</p>
<p>"But there might be enough."</p>

<p>An anger that cannot be hidden. A fury that drives them in battle. Orcs are famed throughout the world as consummate warriors—a reputation that the peace-loving orcs find</p>
<p>The fifth of the speaking peoples, orcs arrived on Orden after humans and elves. They made their homes in the borderlands between those two cultures, preferring the natural forests and avoiding the elf-haunted wodes. For generations, this put them directly in the path of humans who cut down the trees and built roads and farms.</p>
<p>Each orc has within them a fire that causes their veins to glow once blood is drawn. This anger propels them right to the edge of death. The dichotomy between their desire to be left alone and their zeal in battle is summarized in a dwarf proverb:</p>
<p>"Be thankful orcs do not hold grudges."</p>
<h3 id="on-orcs">On Orcs<a class="headerlink" href="#on-orcs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The orc pulled her greataxe from the split skull of the newly dead ogre. Prone heroes scrambled to their feet. Dazar healed the wounded.</p>
<p>The orc hopped down from the corpse of the defeated. "Elg was a ruin ogre," she said. "Infected with a troll disease. An inconvenience for troll-kin but to an ogre …" She indicated the mutated ogre. "You weren't to know."</p>
<p>"Oh, good," Sir John said with obvious relief. "You speak Caelian." "Yes." The orc said. She seemed distant. She gave John a look. "I speak the language of your conquerors."</p>
<p>John smiled. He liked this orc already.</p>
<p>"By the stars!" Ardashir said with open joy on his face. "You saved our lives. It <em>must</em> be you who we seek."</p>
<p>Khorva looked at the assembled heroes. A motley band. "You did most of the work," she said. She seemed disinterested in them and everything.</p>
<p>"You waited until we proved our mettle before acting!" Dazar said, and from the way he spoke it was unclear if this was an accusation or mere observation.</p>
<p>"If you couldn't hold your own," the orc said, "there'd be no point helping you." Her eyes rested on Sir John.</p>
<p>"John," he said.</p>
<p>"Khorva," the orc said.</p>
<p>"Of the Howling," John said.</p>
<p>"<em>Late</em> of the Howling," Khorva said, and looked into the forest with apparent disinterest. <em>Already on the back foot,</em> John thought. <em>Well if it was easy, it wouldn't be called a job.</em></p>
<p>"We've been looking for you," Dazar said.</p>
<p>Khorva nodded without looking at the dwarf.</p>
<p>"I surmised as much," she said. "It seemed your plan was to wander around the wood until something tried to kill you in the hopes of attracting my attention."</p>
<p>"Well, we didn't have a lot of other options," John said. "We seek the chieftain of the Howling."</p>
<p>"That is my brother."</p>
<p>John looked at Embers. "We were told the Howling was led by a woman."</p>
<p>Khorva sighed and looked away into the forest. "My sister died leaving my people leaderless. I tried to save her. I failed. I tried to lead in her stead. I failed." She said these things with no emotion, no inflection. Then her gaze dropped to the sandy ground and her eyes unfocused. A moment passed.</p>
<p>"How clever the dead are," she said, her voice a little hollow, "to torment us from the grave."</p>
<p>John saw the broken swords on her belt. "Five swords," he said. "Five broken swords." He looked at Khorva anew. "I don't think I've ever seen an orc survived three challenges."</p>
<p>"They couldn't kill me and I wouldn't yield." She looked at the group of them skeptically. "Four of you?"</p>
<p>"We just got started," John said defensively. "And I'm working on a friend of mine. We'll see. One of the Storm Knights."</p>
<p>Khorva frowned. "I thought the Dragon Phalanx were dead."</p>
<p>"Yeah well," John said, wishing Vaant was here to watch this. "They couldn't kill him," he broke out in a feral grin. "And he wouldn't yield."</p>
<p>Khorva nodded once, impressed.</p>
<p>"We need the Howling," John said. "If we get you your tribe back …?" Khorva sighed and said nothing for several moments. After a while, she returned from her reverie to look at John.</p>
<p>"I'd rather go fishing."</p>
<p>John smiled. "My sister liked fishing too."</p>
<p>"Why not talk to my brother?"</p>
<p>"Because we are not fools," Embers said, and Khorva locked eyes with her, standing a little straighter. The orc's brown eyes burned and it</p>
<p>seemed the group rose somewhat in her estimation. She nodded once. "The folk of farm and field go to war," Dazar said, using the orcish term for humans. "A war against Lord Saxton and his priest."</p>
<p>Khorva turned to John. "How is this your matter?"</p>
<p>John tried to find a way to tell the story that wouldn't take all day. He kicked at a stone with his boot as he thought.</p>
<p>"A family came to me. They're desperate. Their village is desperate. They can either die, or fight. And they cannot fight. So they hired me."</p>
<p>Khorva raised an eyebrow. "How much did they buy you for?" "Nine copper bits."</p>
<p>Khorva stared at him. "That's nothing"</p>
<p>John shrugged. "It was everything they had. The village sold everything they had left."</p>
<p>John relaxed as he saw Khorva's eyes soften. She understood.</p>
<p>"A difficult offer to refuse," she said.</p>
<p>"Aye." Dazar nodded solemly.</p>
<p>Khorva looked up to watch three crows idly circling, rising, riding a heat haze into the sky. "How many is the opposition?"</p>
<p>"Saxton has no regulars. Just some knights, we can take care of them. But he has the Whitewater. Led by Bonebreaker Dorokor. That's three companies of elite light orc foot against a handful of peasant levies. We need the Howling."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Khorva said, and turned away from the crows to look out over the heroes. "I know Dorokor, she is not like my brother. A head of meat and muscle. Dorokor is a thinker. You seek the Howling because you seek a counter to the Whitewater." She looked at John. "But even better, <em>talk</em> to Dorokor. Deny Saxton his pet orc clan, and <em>earn</em> the allegiance of the Whitewater."</p>
<p>"Is such a thing possible?" Embers asked.</p>
<p>A moment passed. Khorva didn't break eye contact with John. "It's possible," she said.</p>
<p>"The Howling <em>or</em> the Whitewater tribe," Dazar said. "Either would be a formidable foe in any battle, such is the reputation of orcish warlore."</p>
<p>Khorva shook her head. "Orcs have no great love for battle. We love trees and green things. We love an unspoiled land. For this reason did Kul place us in the world. The last of the original speaking peoples."</p>
<p>"But also did Kul place the fire within you," Embers said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Dazar added. "You are not pacifists, you are warriors!"</p>
<p>"We are pacifists," Khorva said with an emphasis that seemed almost a shout. Then a beat of silence and a smile played across her lips. "And we are warriors."</p>
<p>"We're not here to make a deal," John said. "We're not for sale and neither are you. This is about righting a wrong. It's about helping people." He paused and something unrehearsed, unbidden came from his lips.</p>
<p>"It's about living with yourself. Sleeping at night."</p>
<p>"Battles do not bring restful sleep," Khorva said. "The opposite, I find." "Battles bring glory! Battles make heroes!" Dazar insisted, and John</p>
<p>felt like he learned something about the dwarf in that moment. He could hear that Dazar believed this to be true, and knew it was a lie. It was a test.</p>
<p>"War makes only one thing. Corpses." Khorva looked down at the high theochron, who nodded. Test passed.</p>
<p>"And veterans," Sir John said. "Who covet peace." Khorva nodded. Respect. "Aye," she said. She looked at each hero then at John again.</p>
<p>"Well," she said. "What do we do next?"</p>

<p>Short, averaging 31/2 feet tall, the polders' origins are obscure. They are a young species who, like humans, have no single patron god. Their ability to <em>shadowmeld</em> means they enjoy a reputation as excellent spies and thieves. Many polders consider this a base slander and point out they're also famed as chefs, though polders can be found in every profession, especially in cities.</p>

<p>The three peasants—Jago, his wife Sarah, and his sister Beth—sat together watching the three heroes talk in the crowded common room of the inn. Well, Jackson Bootblack seemed to be doing most of the talking.</p>
<p>"This kind of shit doesn't work if it's just a bunch of ratcatchers like us," the polder said. "You need the people to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died—fifteen years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know? They adapt."</p>
<p>"If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie flat," A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers said. "But what do <em>you</em> say?"</p>
<p>"Eh?" the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John staring at him. "You say the people have no stomach for rebellion," Embers said. "But what about you?"</p>
<p>"Oh," the polder said, "I say it doesn't matter much what I say. Why's he looking at me like that?" he asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. "Sorry, I just … I never met a polder before," he said.</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me?" Jackson said.</p>
<p>"No! Sorry, I just …"</p>
<p>"What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you never met a polder before? There's polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea."</p>
<p>"Really? That's weird. I'm from Tor, I've been all over—just never met a polder before."</p>
<p>Jackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage. "Am I crazy?" "You're not crazy." Embers smiled. She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other. "John's just never run into one, it seems."</p>
<p>"Well, we're adorable," the polder said, and drank some ale. "They must have been around I guess," John said. "I probably just never noticed."</p>
<p>The polder put his drink down. "Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it's funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much noise as a cow, which … I don't even know how you manage that."</p>
<p>"You're talking just … my voice is just as loud as yours!"</p>
<p>"I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move, the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn noise."</p>
<p>Jago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.</p>
<p>"Humans are loud, yes," Embers agreed.</p>
<p>"Do we have to … can we talk about something else, please?" John said.</p>
<p>"I just …" The polder wouldn't let it go. "You seriously never … you never been to an inn? Cavall's teeth, I can't count how many inns and taverns I've been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we're good at, I think."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" John asked. "What's the other one?"</p>
<p>The little man smiled. "Getting into places we ain't supposed to be." "Now we're talking," Sir John said. "You were saying we need the people behind us. I agree."</p>
<p>"Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people." The polder took the question seriously. "It's not hard. First, we need someone they'll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that's all. I'll take care of the rest."</p>
<p>"I'm working on that," John said. "But it's … slower going than I thought. I'm betting on a long shot."</p>
<p>"What's the holdup?"</p>
<p>John thought about how to put what he knew into words. "You know …" He shrugged. "Some people can only be heroes if they think they're better than everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they're not. And some people …"</p>
<p>He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table, and now he was mostly talking to himself. "Some people still have to figure that out."</p>
<p>"Which is best?" Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.</p>
<p>John took a deep breath and came back to reality. "Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero," he said.</p>
<p>The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed. "Okay. Well, if you've already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: We need a good story—short, punchy. Something that'll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre … no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy."</p>
<p>"Where are we going to find three ogres?" John asked.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Now it was the polder's turn to be confused. "What do you mean, 'What do I mean?'" John said.</p>
<p>"I'm not … we don't need <em>real</em> ogres." Jackson looked at the elf. "Is he for real?"</p>
<p>"Trust me," the void mage said.</p>
<p>"You mean you're going to make it up?!" John exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I …" Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. "Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?" he asked the elf.</p>
<p>"He'll learn." Embers smiled.</p>
<p>The polder turned back to Sir John. "Hello. I lie for a living. And I'm <em>really good at it</em>. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn't work."</p>
<p>John turned to Embers. "I thought he was a thief."</p>
<p>"I was a thief," the polder said.</p>
<p>"You <em>were</em> a thief."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am—they don't exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything."</p>
<p>"Did they kick you out, or did you quit?"</p>
<p>"Depends on who you ask. I don't like being told what to do. It's sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook."</p>
<p>"So what are you now?"</p>
<p>"I'm annoying."</p>
<p>The elf smiled. "He's a troubadour—one of the best."</p>
<p>Sir John looked at him, nodded. "No lute, I notice. And you don't seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories."</p>
<p>The polder grinned. "I ain't that kind of troubadour. I'm the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other."</p>
<p>"Propaganda," Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't notable, but the gasp from the customers was.</p>
<p>"Hey," the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. "Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys."</p>
<p>John turned to see.</p>
<p>Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.</p>
<p>"I, uh …" Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.</p>
<p>The dragon knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.</p>
<p>"Maybe you're right," he said.</p>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You flatten yourself into a shadow against a wall or floor you are touching, and become hidden from any creature you have cover or concealment from or who isn't observing you. While in shadow form, you have full awareness of your surroundings, and strikes made against you and tests made to search for you take a bane. You can't move or be force moved, and you can't take main actions or maneuvers except to exit this form or to direct creatures under your control, such as one you summon using an ability. Any ability or effect that targets more than 1 square affects you in this form only if it explicitly affects the surface you are flattened against. You can exit this form as a maneuver.
If the surface you are flattened against is destroyed, this ability ends and you take 1d6 damage that can't be reduced in any way.</p>

<p>The dead walk among us. Some of them are happier about it than others.</p>
<p>Unlike the necromantic rituals that produce wights and wraiths and zombies, revenants rise from the grave through a combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for vengeance. Creatures sustained on pure will, they have no need of food or water or air—and, unlike their zombified cousins, they retain all their memories and personality from life.</p>
<p>These revenants are rare. Many are hunted by ignorant villagers who see only their dead flesh and assume the worst. Those who survive the pitchfork brigade either choose a solitary life, often as a wandering soul seeking out living company yet constantly in fear of it, or they migrate to a metropolis such as Blackbottom or Capital, where lost souls gather to make a home.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, we are being <em>followed</em>."</p>
<p>"No one knows we're here. No one even knows this place <em>exists</em>! We got all day. We stash everything here, and take a sample to …" The head thief pulled a vial out of a crate stuffed with straw and looked at it.</p>
<p>"It's just …" The junior cutpurse spoke nervously. "There was this lady knight in Blackbottom sniffing around. She seemed serious. I got this weird … chill when I looked at her."</p>
<p>"Hey," the head thief said, his brow furrowed as he looked at the label on the vial. "Where'd you say you bought this stuff ? You said a ship—a ship from where?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, uh … uh, Capital I think."</p>
<p>The head thief looked at the panicking cutpurse. "This lady knight she have a red and blue device on her shield?"</p>
<p>"It can't be Lady Filliamo, can it?" one of the other thieves said. There was a firm knock at the door to the safe house. A door which,</p>
<p>from the outside, looked like an unremarkable section of wall.</p>
<p>"Oh, you've got to be kidding me."</p>
<p>"Nonono! How could she … Capital was <em>nine months ago!</em>"</p>
<p>"She's a revenant, idiot! She doesn't even need air. She could have walked here! Just … into the water and across the bottom of the sea! Why didn't you say anything?"</p>
<p>"I did! You asshole, I just did! I been trying to tell you for—"</p>
<p>"Man, there is a <em>difference</em> between, 'Hey I think we're being shadowed,' and, 'There's a deathless <em>copper</em> coming after us!'"</p>
<p>One of the four thieves opened a vial and dipped his dirk into the red oil within.</p>
<p>"What is <em>that</em> gonna do? <em>She's already dead!</em>" Another knock at the hidden door. "Forget it. Let her knock. Grab as many as you can, and we'll go out the back."</p>
<p>The head thief ran for the door out the back of the safe house. He jerked it open—and the other thieves watched as a silver flash silently flared across his forehead. Through the open door, they could see the silhouette of the knight, her open hand held up in front of her.</p>
<p>She clenched her hand into a fist and the <em>judgment</em> she had placed on the head cutpurse detonated, hurling him backward. He sprawled across the floor, conscious but stunned.</p>
<p>The gray-skinned knight walked into the room. Metal heels rang out on the wooden floor. She seemed relaxed, but her eyes burned with inner fire.</p>
<p>"Boys," Lady Filliamo said pleasantly. "Busy morning."</p>
<p>"How did you … this is impossible, how did you <em>find</em> us?" She looked at the man groaning on the floor. "Your boss didn't tell you about the vengeance mark?"</p>
<p>"You marked us. Back in Capital. You marked one of us and just … just <em>walked</em> here."</p>
<p>"Don't be stupid. I marked you in Blackbottom. Capital was just normal detective work. I came here by <em>ship</em>." She smiled—black lips on pale gray skin.</p>
<p>"Come on." The braver of the three remaining thieves drew twin daggers. "She can't get all of us at—"</p>
<p>Lady Filliamo made a broad gesture with her right hand and argent marks flared across the foreheads of all three thieves. A clatter of</p>
<p>weapons hitting the floor. Three pairs of hands slowly rose in the air. "Good boys. Here, put these on." She tossed three pairs of manacles on the floor.</p>
<p>"Hang on, you can't arrest us," one of the thieves, unarmed and still holding his hands up, said. "This isn't Capital. You don't have jurisdiction!"</p>
<p>Lady Filliamo shrugged. "I'm a knight of the church. Jurisdiction's for the city watch." She drew her silver sword a few inches from the scabbard just to show them the blade.</p>

<p>The original servitor species of the synliroi—evil psions with near godlike power—the kuran'zoi liberated themselves during the First Psychic War. In the centuries since, they built their own culture and civilization as nomads of the timescape. The exonym "time raiders" was given to them by denizens of the lower worlds who, seeing the advanced technology the kuran'zoi wield, concluded they must be from the future.</p>
<p>Extraordinarily rare in Orden, time raiders thrive on the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, where the winds of limbo roar.</p>
<p>In place of eyes, kuran'zoi possess crystalline ocular sensors that grant them high-spectral vision and which are hardened against the extreme radiations encountered in the Sea of Stars, permitting them to operate freely outside their vessels with only their portable rebreathers. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.</p>
<h3 id="on-time-raiders">On Time Raiders<a class="headerlink" href="#on-time-raiders" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>"You will tell me the location of the ship you came here in." Taxiarch Lycaon paced outside the ruined stone church. The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the church.</p>
<p>"Is it that your brain is so small you must <em>talk</em> in order to <em>think</em>?" The woman's smile was a sneer.</p>
<p>Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. "You are going to die in any event," he said. "If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly."</p>
<p>Up close, she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.</p>
<p>"You seem to be made of <em>bits</em>," the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. "And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of castoff <em>scraps</em>? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and <em>useless</em> in the timescape."</p>
<p>The taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blond.</p>
<p>He struck a casual, jaunty pose. "Where is your worldship?" he said in a more reasonable voice. "Or came you here in a single-seater <em>starskimmer</em>?" At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise. "You see?" the taxiarch said, impressed with himself. "I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien." He nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. "I am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was <em>made</em> for victory." Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. "If you agree to <em>lead me</em> to your vessel, I will let you go free."</p>
<p>The alien sighed. "'Blaap blaap blaap,'" she said. "You should hear yourself. Like barking <em>thrazz</em>, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble." She nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.</p>
<p>Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.</p>
<p>"Look how easily this one is goaded!" she said. She spat out dark-blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. "You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these … <em>bits</em>? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these."</p>
<p>"Perhaps from the air," Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. "I could scout the forest around the …"</p>
<p>"No!" Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the Hawklord and strode toward her. "<em>You</em> are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, <em>I</em> am his chosen brigade commander. <em>We</em> are not scavengers! This one …" he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, "… will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs." He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.</p>
<p>"They may pull you apart," he said to her, and at this his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.</p>
<p>"Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones." At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.</p>
<p>"Shall I let you choose?" the taxiarch said, and drew a dagger from his belt. "I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, <em>I</em> kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out <em>then</em> …"</p>
<p>Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.</p>
<p>"… should be ready for anything," one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the Hawklord, and the taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice," another voice, high pitched, piped up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and seven heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A dwarf with his battle-staff tipped with an hourglass. An orc with a huge battleaxe casually resting on her shoulder. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. An unarmed hakaan towering over everyone. And a dragon knight. Of all the motley band, it was the dragon knight who caused the people of the town to gasp. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.</p>
<p>The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the taxiarch bellowed "Hold fast!" and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them against the certain fear of their commander.</p>
<p>The hakaan looked around and saw a clump of villagers watching the scene from a distance, gathered around what looked like some stables. He waved. "Hello!" he said, smiling.</p>
<p>One of the villagers waved back before being shushed.</p>
<p>John looked at the taxiarch and immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.</p>
<p>There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty—reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional—could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.</p>
<p>Not the war dogs—they were fanatics.</p>
<p>"What's this?" the taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. "Allies of the alien?" He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.</p>
<p>"Allies of all those who suffer, and seek justice," the dwarf announced. Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. "Embers?"</p>
<p>"A kuran'zoi," the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. "A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear."</p>
<p>John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers explicitly.</p>
<p>He could see the shape of the next moments play out. All he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.</p>
<p>John knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the taxiarch didn't react. That spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.</p>
<p>"She goes free," John commanded, his voice steel, "or you die here." He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.</p>
<p>Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.</p>
<p>"I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these … creatures?" The war dog taxiarch looked at the elf, giant, polder, dwarf, and dragon knight. "Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you …"—his voice lowered almost to a whisper—"… to be on the winning side for a change."</p>
<p>Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.</p>
<p>Ember's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.</p>
<p>The time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.</p>
<p>John felt his skin tighten as Dazar warded him, and from the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one saw him move from where he'd been a moment before.</p>
<p>The hakaan burst into action and sped past him like a blur.</p>
<p>At the same instant, a call—a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in his heart—the clarion call of the last Storm Knight!</p>
<p>At the sound, the orc dashed forward into a knot of wardog commandos, her axe already hewing about her.</p>
<p>John hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword and falchion. "All right, you patchwork son of a bitch." He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the shortsword on his belt.</p>

<p>Your mind allows you to maintain your focus in any situation. You can't be made dazed.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>What makes a hero? Is their desire to stand up for the innocent and protect others somehow innate? Are they born knowing that tyrants must fall? Does a higher power instill the idea that sometimes those least deserving of compassion are those who need it most?</p>
<p>No. A hero's life experience and background make them what they are. That background starts with the culture in which a hero was raised, and is threaded through the career that led them to a life of adventuring.</p>
<h2 id="culture">Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#culture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A hero's culture describes the beliefs, customs, values, and way of life held by the community in which they were raised. This community provides life experiences that give a character some of their game statistics. Even if a hero doesn't share their culture's values, those values shaped their early development and way of life. In fact, some people become heroes primarily from the rejection of the ways of their culture.</p>
<p>For our purposes, a hero's culture represents people, not a place. Yes, you might have grown up in the great city of Capital, but your culture is more specific than that. One hero's culture might be House Alvaro, a noble house in Capital where they were raised. Another's culture could be a group or organization that moves around, such as a band of pirates or a secret order of sorcerers sworn to protect books of fell magic. It helps to get specific when thinking about your culture, and working with the four aspects of a culture can help you do that: <strong>language</strong>, <strong>environment</strong>, <strong>organization</strong>, and <strong>upbringing</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="using-culture">Using Culture<a class="headerlink" href="#using-culture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Directors can use the rules in this section to build cultures that players can choose for their characters. Players can use these rules to build a unique culture or modify an existing culture for their character, working with the Director to find the right place for that culture within the world of the campaign.</p>
<p>In many worlds, at least some cultures have a majority ancestry. The people of Bedegar, a duchy in the region of Vasloria on Orden, are mostly humans. The folk dwelling in the Great Wode, a forest realm north of Bedegar, are primarily wode elves. However, you can always choose to be from one of these cultures and take a different ancestry. A dwarf raised in the culture of the Great Wode speaks Yllyric and probably knows a lot about nature, while a dwarf raised in the dwarf thanedom of Kal Kalavar speaks Zaliac and might know a good deal about smithing.</p>
<p>You can build your culture one aspect at a time, or you can use the following tables if you want to assess sample cultures or make your own culture quickly. To create an archetypical culture for a hero who grew up surrounded mostly by other members of their ancestry, use or modify the aspect options on the Typical Ancestry Cultures table. (Revenants are missing from this table because they don't gain their ancestry until after they die.) If you'd rather quickly create a culture based on a cultural archetype, such as a noble house or a pirate crew, use the Archetypical Cultures table, then add a language that fits the culture's concept.</p>

<h3 id="why-build-a-culture">Why Build a Culture?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-build-a-culture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Building a character is about more than adding up your stats, picking skills and abilities, and recording that information on a character sheet. You're building a hero—a main character in a story, be it a one-shot or a heroic campaign. Think about the personality and the past of who you are creating. That's why the game lets you build a culture rather than simply saying, "Pick three skills and a bonus language." We want players to imagine their heroes as complex and intricate characters.</p>
<h3 id="culture-benefits">Culture Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#culture-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The culture you choose or create grants you the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You know the language of your culture, in addition to knowing Caelian.</li>
<li>From the environment, organization, and upbringing aspects of your culture, you gain access to skills. You can select one skill from each aspect's list of options. (<a href="#page-268-0">Skills</a> in Chapter 9: Tests has information on the part skills play in the game.)</li>
<li>You gain an edge on tests made to recall lore about your culture, and on tests made to influence and interact with people of your culture. (See <a href="#page-19-6">Edges and Banes</a> in <a href="#page-17-3">Chapter 1: The Basics</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="language">Language<a class="headerlink" href="#language" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your culture's language aspect determines how the people of your culture communicate. <a href="#page-70-0">Languages in Orden</a> below discusses the many languages of the world of Orden, including Caelian—the language of the fallen empire that once dominated that world.</p>
<h4 id="environment">Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#environment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your culture's environment aspect describes where the people of that culture spend most of their time. Is your culture centered in a bustling city or a small village? Did you spend your early life in an isolated monastery? Or did you wander the wilderness, never staying in one place for long?</p>
<p>When you build a culture, select its environment aspect from the following options: nomadic, rural, secluded, urban, or wilderness. You gain skill options from your chosen environment. All of these environments can be found in any sort of terrain, whether aboveground, in subterranean caverns, deep in trackless forest, or even underwater.</p>
<h5 id="nomadic">Nomadic<a class="headerlink" href="#nomadic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A nomadic culture travels from place to place to survive. Members of a nomadic culture might follow animal migrations or the weather, travel to sell their wares or services, or simply enjoy a restless lifestyle full of new experiences and peoples. Those who grow up in nomadic cultures learn to navigate the wilderness and work closely with others to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the exploration or interpersonal skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Navigate.)</p>
<h5 id="rural">Rural<a class="headerlink" href="#rural" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A rural culture is one located in a town, village, or smaller settled enclave. People dwelling in such places often cultivate the land, trade goods or services with travelers passing through, harvest fish from the sea, or mine metals and gems from the earth.</p>
<p>Living among a small population, most folks in a rural community learn a trade and are handed down bits of essential knowledge to help their community survive. For example, when a rural culture has only one blacksmith, it's important to have an apprentice already learning at the anvil well before that smith starts to get old. If the only priest in town</p>
<p>gets the sniffles, folks want an acolyte ready to wear the fancy robes should the worst occur.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the crafting or lore skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Nature.)</p>
<h5 id="secluded">Secluded<a class="headerlink" href="#secluded" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A secluded culture is based in one relatively close-quarters structure—a building, a cavern, and so forth—and interacts with other cultures only rarely. Such places are often buildings or complexes such as monasteries, castles, or prisons. Folk in a secluded culture have little or no reason to leave their home or interact with other cultures on the outside, but might have an awareness of those cultures and of events happening beyond their enclave.</p>
<p>When people live together in close quarters, they typically learn to get along. They often spend much time in study or introspection, as there is not much else to do in seclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the interpersonal or lore skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Read Person.)</p>
<h5 id="urban">Urban<a class="headerlink" href="#urban" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>An urban culture is always centered in a city. Such a culture might arise within the walls of Capital, a massive metropolis with a cosmopolitan population; within a network of caverns that hold an underground city; or in any other place where a large population lives relatively close together. The people of urban cultures often learn to effectively misdirect others in order to navigate the crowds and the political machinations that can come with city life.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the interpersonal or intrigue skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Alertness.)</p>
<h5 id="wilderness">Wilderness<a class="headerlink" href="#wilderness" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A wilderness culture doesn't try to tame the terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest, swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their sustenance and shelter from the land. A wilderness culture might be a circle of druids protecting a remote wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the land for all they need to live, typically crafting their own tools, clothing, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the crafting or exploration skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Endurance.)</p>
<h4 id="organization">Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#organization" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your culture's organization aspect determines the functioning and leadership of your community. You might come from a place with an officially recognized government and a system of laws. Or your culture might have enjoyed a less-formal organization, with the people in charge having naturally gravitated toward their positions without any official offices or oaths.</p>
<p>When you build a culture, select its organization aspect from the following options: bureaucratic or communal. You gain skill options from your chosen system of organization.</p>
<h5 id="bureaucratic">Bureaucratic<a class="headerlink" href="#bureaucratic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official leadership and formally recorded laws. Members of such a culture are often ranked in power according to those laws, with a small group of people holding the power to rule according to birthright, popular vote, or some other official and measurable standard. Many bureaucratic communities</p>
<p>have one person at the top, though others might be ruled by a council. A trade guild with a guildmaster, treasurer, secretary, and a charter of rules and regulations for membership; a feudal lord who rules over a group of knights who in turn rule over peasants working the land; and a militaristic society with ranks and rules that its people must abide are all examples of bureaucratic cultures.</p>
<p>Those who thrive in bureaucratic cultures don't simply follow the rules. They know how to use those rules to their advantage, either bending, changing, or reinterpreting policy to advance their own interests. Schmoozing with those who make the laws is often key to this approach. Others in a bureaucratic culture might specialize in operating outside the strict regulations that govern the culture without getting caught.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the interpersonal or intrigue skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Persuade.)</p>
<h5 id="communal">Communal<a class="headerlink" href="#communal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A communal culture is a place where all members of the culture are considered equal. The community works together to make important decisions that affect the majority of the culture. While they elect leaders to carry out these decisions and organize their efforts, each person has a relatively equal say in how the culture operates, and everyone contributes to help their people survive and thrive. Individuals often share the burdens of governing, physical labor, childcare, and other duties. A collective of farmers who work together to cultivate and protect their land without a noble, a city of pirates where each person can do as they wish, and a traveling theatrical troupe whose members vote on every artistic and administrative decision are all communal cultures.</p>
<p>Many communal cultures operate outside settled lands, sticking to the wilds, a specific district in a larger settlement, city sewers, forgotten ruins, or other isolated places. For even when such cultures are harmless, their members know that outsiders might try to impose rules upon them if they live in the same place. As such, many folks in communal cultures focus on fending for themselves while avoiding the danger that other groups can represent.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the crafting or exploration skill groups. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Jump.)</p>
<h4 id="upbringing">Upbringing<a class="headerlink" href="#upbringing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your culture's upbringing aspect is a more specific and personal part of your hero's story, describing how you were raised within your culture. Were you trained to become the newest archmage in a secret order of wizards, or to be a sword-wielding bodyguard who protected that arcane organization? Did you learn to delve deep into mines looking for ore in a mountain kingdom, or did you build machines meant to dig faster and deeper than any person could alone? Whatever your culture, your upbringing makes you special within that culture.</p>
<p>Pick your upbringing aspect from the following list: academic, creative, labor, lawless, martial, or noble. You gain skill options from your chosen aspect.</p>
<h5 id="academic">Academic<a class="headerlink" href="#academic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your hero was raised by people who collect, study, and share books and other records. Some academics focus on one area of study, such as a college for wizards dedicated to the study of magic, or a church that teaches the word of one deity. People in an academic culture learn how to wield the power that is knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the lore skill group. (<em>Quick Build:</em> History.)</p>
<h5 id="creative">Creative<a class="headerlink" href="#creative" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A hero with a creative upbringing was raised among folk who create art or other works valuable enough to trade. A creative culture might produce fine art such as dance, music, or sculpture, or more practical wares such as wagons, weapons, tools, or buildings. People in such cultures learn the value of quality crafting and attention to detail.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> The Music or Perform skill (from the interpersonal skill group), or one skill from the crafting group. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Perform.)</p>
<h5 id="labor">Labor<a class="headerlink" href="#labor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your hero came of age in a culture where people labored for a living. They might have been cultivators, typically raising crops or livestock on a farm. They might have harvested natural resources, whether by hunting, trapping, logging, or mining. Or they might have excelled at manual labor tied to settlement and trade, such as construction, carting, loading cargo, and so forth. People with a labor upbringing know the value of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> The Blacksmithing skill (from the crafting skill group), the Handle Animals skill (from the interpersonal group), or a skill from the exploration group. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Lift.)</p>
<h5 id="lawless">Lawless<a class="headerlink" href="#lawless" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your hero grew up among folk who performed activities that other people—whether within or outside their culture—considered unlawful. A band of pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of spies all commit unlawful acts for money. And under tyranny, people engaged in rebellion are often considered lawless in their actions and activities. People brought up in a lawless culture typically don't mind breaking the rules when it suits them—and are good at making sure no one finds out they did.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the intrigue skill group. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Sneak.)</p>
<h5 id="martial">Martial<a class="headerlink" href="#martial" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A hero with a martial upbringing was raised by warriors. These might have been the soldiers of an established army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around combat. Heroes with a martial upbringing are always ready for a fight—and they know how to finish that fight.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One of the following: Blacksmithing or Fletching from the crafting skill group; Climb, Endurance, or Ride from the exploration group; Intimidate from the interpersonal group; Alertness or Track from the intrigue group; or Monsters or Strategy from the lore skill group (<em>Quick Build:</em> Intimidate.)</p>
<h5 id="noble">Noble<a class="headerlink" href="#noble" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your hero grew up among leaders who rule over others and play the games of politics to maintain power. Many families are nobles by birthright, but some cultures have noble titles earned through deeds or popularity. Whatever the case, heroes with this background understand why the whispered words in the right ear can sometimes be more powerful than any army.</p>
<p><strong>Skill Options:</strong> One skill from the interpersonal skill group. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Lead.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>But I Really Want Alertness</strong></p>
<p>If the culture you create doesn't grant a skill that you want, check with your Director about modifying what the culture's aspects offer. For instance, you can easily make the case that a culture with the noble upbringing aspect should give a character access to the Alertness skill, given that living among those who covet your power means always being aware of your surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="languages-in-orden">Languages in Orden<a class="headerlink" href="#languages-in-orden" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The languages granted by your hero's culture shape their understanding of the world and their relationship to the creatures within it. The following section details the languages of Orden, the baseline world of the game, but the Director can use these languages in their own campaign world or can swap this list with their own list of languages.</p>
<p>If your hero knows a language, they can speak, read, write, and understand it.</p>
<h5 id="caelian-empire">Caelian Empire<a class="headerlink" href="#caelian-empire" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The Caelian Empire dominated five of the eight regions of Orden 3,000 years ago. During the height of this most recent human empire, all humans (including folks from Vanigar in the far north, but not folks from the islands of Ix). learned to speak the Caelian tongue. For many, especially the noble classes and the well-to-do, Caelian effectively replaced their native language.</p>
<p>Some 1,300 years after the fall of the Caelian Empire, the languages of the different regions of the empire are enjoying a resurgence. Still, the Caelian tongue is spoken by most humans in most regions to one extent or another.</p>
<p>Most people in Orden can speak and understand some Caelian, simply because the empire was so powerful and so widespread. Anyone trading with the empire or living near its borders or under its influence eventually learned to speak Caelian, including dwarves, dragon knights, elves, hakaan, orcs, polders, lizardfolk, and goblins. If a person speaks more than one language in Orden, the second language is almost always Caelian. All player characters know Caelian! As a result, that language of empire is now colloquially referred to as "the common tongue"—the language that most folk of Orden have in common.</p>
<h5 id="extant-languages">Extant Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#extant-languages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Folk have been speaking, signing, and writing in Orden for at least thirty thousand years, but most of the world's ancient languages are now dead. Many have been forgotten. Others were spoken by peoples who never developed writing, preventing those languages from being preserved. And many languages that were preserved in writing left no related descendants, so that no one now knows what sounds that writing represented.</p>
<p>The languages on the Vaslorian Languages by Ancestry table are the most common languages in that region, actively spoken and signed by significant populations of people. The Vaslorian Human Languages table shows the dominant languages in that region's human-centric territories. Most languages are associated with a specific ancestry and its culture, but being a member of an ancestry doesn't automatically make you part of the associated culture the language is tied to. For example, if your orc hero was raised in a culture of elves, you probably speak one of the elf languages, and might never have learned Kalliak.</p>
<p>Most languages have colloquial or casual names. For instance, many people in Orden call Kalliak "Orcish" and Hyrallic "Elvish," but any sage knows there are lots of orcish and elf languages, just as there are multiple human languages.</p>
<p>Each extant language has a spoken, signed, and written version. When you learn a language, you know how to speak, sign, and read it.</p>

<h5 id="language-usage">Language Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#language-usage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p><strong>Hyrallic</strong> is the primary language of the high elves in Orden. Although young for an elf language, Hyrallic is older than almost all other modern cultural languages, save those of the dwarves. As a result, while anyone who lives near or trades with a human culture probably speaks at least a little Caelian, most nobles across all ancestries make sure their children or offspring speak Hyrallic. Caelian is new from many cultures' point of view, while Hyrallic as a language for diplomacy is considered cultured and traditional.</p>
<p><strong>Yllyric</strong> is the cultural language of wode elves, and also the common language among those who defend and protect the natural forests of Orden.</p>
<p>Within any document concerning the workings of machines, masonry, or geology, you are likely to find a healthy supply of jargon using <strong>Zaliac</strong>, the most popular dwarf language. Even when such texts aren't fully written in Zaliac, they use a lot of dwarf language when describing esoteric, complex ideas.</p>
<p>Just as Zaliac is used in engineering, contract law isn't written purely in <strong>Anjali</strong>, the dominant language of the Seven Cities of Hell. But a lot of the legal jargon in any contract, as well as some of the language of trial courts, features many Anjali words. People are sticklers for detail in the Seven Cities, and this makes their language popular among lawyers.</p>
<p>In the same way that intelligent creatures in Orden who live near or trade with other cultures use Caelian as a common language, the denizens of the World Below, the Dark Under All, often speak <strong>Variac</strong>, the language of the voiceless talkers.</p>
<h5 id="dead-languages">Dead Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#dead-languages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>For an adventuring hero with an ambition to create great works or unlock deep lore, being able to read ancient writing is most useful. Much deep lore is attested only in ancient tomes and scrolls written in languages that no modern culture uses.</p>
<p>Most of these ancient writings were written by people who expected other people to read it. The lore might have been kept secret by not sharing it with anyone outside the college or cult whose members originally wrote it, but the actual writing was not intended to be difficult to read or understand. It wasn't written in code—just in a language that people stopped speaking long ago.</p>
<p>Sages can reconstruct many of these languages by learning which modern languages descended from them, then comparing them to related languages from the same time period that might have survived. Translating such ancient languages has been extremely useful for crafting and research.</p>
<p>The Dead Languages table shows some of the dead languages of Orden, and the modern languages related to those ancient languages.</p>

<p>Being a hero isn't a job. It's a calling. But before you answered that call, you had a different job or vocation that paid the bills. Thank the gods for that, because the experience you gained in that career is now helping you save lives and slay monsters.</p>
<h3 id="career-questions">Career Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#career-questions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The careers in this section don't go into great detail about the actual jobs they represent. We assume that you know the basics of what an artisan, a criminal, or a gladiator does for a living. However, each career includes a list of questions you should think about to help you define the specific details of your hero's career. For instance, if you pick the Artisan career, one of the questions is: "What did you create?"</p>
<p>You don't need to answer these questions, but doing so can help shape a more complete picture of your hero. And if you do answer them, consider telling your Director the answers so they can think about working those details into the game. Directors already have a lot to juggle, but they certainly can't create dramatic moments from your backstory if you never tell them what that backstory is.</p>
<h3 id="career-benefits">Career Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#career-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Your career describes what your life was before you became a hero. When you select a career, you gain a number of benefits, the details of which are specified in the career's description.</p>
<h4 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each career grants you two or three skills, detailed in the <a href="#page-268-0">Skills</a> section of Chapter 9: Tests.</p>
<h4 id="languages">Languages<a class="headerlink" href="#languages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some careers allow you to learn extra languages, chosen from those available in <a href="#page-70-0">Languages in Orden</a> above.</p>
<h4 id="renown">Renown<a class="headerlink" href="#renown" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some careers increase your starting Renown score (from a base score of 0). See <a href="#page-364-6">Renown</a> in <a href="#page-327-1">Chapter 13: Rewards</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="wealth">Wealth<a class="headerlink" href="#wealth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some careers increase your starting Wealth score (from a base score of 1). See <a href="#page-365-0">Wealth</a> in <a href="#page-327-1">Chapter 13: Rewards</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="project-points">Project Points<a class="headerlink" href="#project-points" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some careers provide project points you can put toward crafting and research projects (see <a href="#page-307-2">Chapter 12: Downtime Projects</a>). These project points can be divided among multiple projects, but they can't be used more than once. You must meet the other prerequisites for a project to start it, as usual.</p>
<p>At the Director's discretion, your career might also let you start the game with the materials needed for one or more projects, so you can immediately put your project points toward those projects—possibly before the adventure begins! This is especially useful for characters who are going on only one adventure. Otherwise, you can hold onto the points and spend them once you do start a project.</p>
<h4 id="perk">Perk<a class="headerlink" href="#perk" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your career provides you with a specific type of perk—a special feature that lets you customize your character, with a focus outside of combat. See <a href="#page-241-0">Chapter 7: Perks</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="inciting-incident">Inciting Incident<a class="headerlink" href="#inciting-incident" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each career has a list of inciting incidents, each of which suggests a potential reason why you gave up your career, turned away from a possibly comfortable and reliable living, and took up the sword (or axe or wand) to become an adventuring hero. Each inciting incident represents a life-changing event that might have motivated you to change course, becoming a person who risks it all to save others.</p>
<p>You can roll for or choose an inciting incident from the table that accompanies each career. You can also use your career's table (or another career's table) as inspiration as you work with your Director to come up with a unique inciting incident of your own.</p>
<h4 id="what-was-taken-from-you">What Was Taken From You?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-taken-from-you" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>During your inciting incident, something was taken from you. It might have been a material object, such as an heirloom sword or a locket that proves your royal heritage. Perhaps a person you loved was killed, kidnapped, or cursed. It might be something deeper and more abstract, such as a chance for happiness, belief in the future, belief in basic goodness, or a lifetime goal snatched away.</p>
<p>It might be the case that you're obsessed with getting back what you lost. You might be in a position where you'll never recover what was taken from you, but you want to prevent that same loss from happening to others. Perhaps your loss left you in a position where helping others is the only thing that gives your life meaning. Whatever the case, the loss you've suffered is part of what drives you to be a hero. Record what was taken from you on your character sheet, and let your Director know.</p>

<td><strong>Disavowed:</strong> While on a dangerous espionage assignment, things went sideways. Although you escaped with your life, the mission was a public failure thanks to bad information your agency gave you. They denied you work for them, and you went on the run. Hero work will let you survive and clear your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td><strong>Faceless:</strong> Your identity was always hidden. It was your way of protecting those around you because the work you did spying on powerful entities came with dangers. Then your world came crashing down when an enemy agent unmasked you, causing you to lose everything—your privacy, livelihood, loved ones, all gone in the blink of an eye. Instead of going into hiding, you became a public hero to protect the innocent in the name of those you lost.</td>

<td><strong>Free Agent:</strong> There was a time in your life when you used to sell information to the highest bidder. Your acts were unsanctioned by any one organization, but you were well-connected enough to trade in secrets. Politics never mattered much to you until the information you sold wound up causing a ripple effect of harm that eventually destroyed the place you once called home. You became a hero to make up for your past.</td>

<td><strong>Informed:</strong> After years of cultivating a rich list of informants, one of those informants risked everything to expose the heinous plans of powerful individuals. You promised to protect your informant, but your agency left them hanging—literally. You cut ties with your employer and swore to always make good on your word as a hero.</td>

They discovered you were a double agent, and though you insisted your feelings were real, the deceit cut too deep for your love interest to ignore. They exposed you, spurned you, or died because of their closeness to you. You left the espionage business to become a hero with nothing to hide.</td>

You decided to use your riches to fund your life as a hero, whether publicly or using an alter ego.</td>

<td><strong>Privileged Position:</strong> Life outside the manor never piqued your interest. You had everything you wanted. It thus came as a surprise when the peasants came to overthrow your family. You narrowly escaped, and for the first time witnessed the world. It caused you to become a hero for the people, fighting against inequities.</td>

<td><strong>Royal Pauper:</strong> Seeking a break from noble duties, you sought a lookalike to switch identities with. It went so well that you made a habit of switching whenever you were bored. Unfortunately, your counterpart became so good at imitating you that they convinced all those around you that you were an impostor. You lost contact with your family, but now pursue a heroic path free of the pomp of your old life.</td>

To honor their legacy, you took up the mantle of a hero with the intent of finishing your friend's work.</td>

You left your hometown, seeking your lost art and encouraging others to live freely.</td>

<td><strong>Night Terrors:</strong> Something killed the other beggars. It came in the night. You barely saw it, but what you did see of it wasn't natural.

You took the gold, bought some secondhand gear, and went to pay that hero's kindness forward.</td>

When a pickpocket stole that object, you chased them until you were in a part of the city you no longer recognized. With a jolt, you realized you had no desire to return to your previous stomping grounds. You kept going, and you haven't looked back.</td>

<p>You served as an officer of the law for a local government. You might have been a single person in a much larger city watch or the only constable patrolling a small village. In defining your career, think about the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of settlement did you protect?</li>
<li>What was your law enforcement style like? Were you a by-the-book officer, a more lenient-but-fair type, or totally corrupt?</li>
<li>What criminal still eludes your grasp to this day?</li>
<li>Whose life did you save in the line of duty?</li>
<li>What is the most absurd call you ever responded to and how did you handle it?</li>

<h1 id="classes">Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#classes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>While all your character creation decisions bear narrative weight, none influences the way you play the game like your choice of class. Your class determines how your hero battles the threats of the timescape and overcomes other obstacles. Do you bend elemental forces to your will through the practiced casting of magic spells? Do you channel the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos as you tear across the battlefield, felling foes left and right? Or do you belt out heroic ballads that give your allies a second wind and inspire them to ever-greater achievements?</p>
<p>Your class provides you with many of your features, most of your abilities—your most potent combat moves and noncombat options and a Heroic Resource that fuels many of those abilities. This book presents nine classes to choose from.</p>
<p><strong>Censor:</strong> A censor is a trained warrior devoted to a saint or god. They hunt down the forces of evil using melee weapons and magic granted to them by their divine patron, specializing in confronting the wicked and locking down single enemies during combat.</p>
<p><strong>Conduit:</strong> A conduit is the devoted priest of a saint or god. They wield divine magic that smites enemies with holy energy and supports their allies, and are renowned for their healing abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Elementalist:</strong> An elementalist studies the elemental forces of the timescape and controls earth, fire, the void, and more with magic. Many of their abilities cover wide areas of the battlefield, and they have a versatile array of tricks that allow them to both control combat and manipulate the environment around them when the fight is done.</p>
<p><strong>Fury:</strong> Coursing with the ferocity of the Primordial Chaos in their veins, a fury is a mobile warrior who gets up close and personal with enemies to dish out lots of damage. Leaping around the battlefield felling foes and breaking down walls is where the fury lives.</p>
<p><strong>Null:</strong> Disciplined and calm, the null is an unarmed warrior who manifests an aura that quells the supernatural and hinders the offensive prowess of their enemies. They use psionics to make their body stronger than any steel and faster than any steed.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow:</strong> Stalking from the darkness, the shadow is an expert assassin and thief who fights equally well in melee and at range as they get the drop on their foes. They utilize magic to help them stay mobile on the battlefield and sneak up on their prey.</p>
<p><strong>Tactician:</strong> A brilliant strategist and weapons master, the tactician excels at granting allies more movement and actions on the battlefield. They also support allies outside of combat, always inspiring their friends to greatness.</p>
<p><strong>Talent:</strong> A talent is the master of psionics, manifesting powers that manipulate objects, minds, and time. These heroes can reach far into themselves to use abilities even when they don't have their Heroic Resource to spare—if they're willing to face the cost.</p>
<p><strong>Troubadour:</strong> A troubadour inspires their allies with storytelling and swordplay that is as much an art as it is an act of war. Their quips, songs, poems, and epic tales produce actual magic that harms foes and bolsters allies. They can even use their magic to tweak the campaign's story in real time to better suit their needs.</p>
<h3 id="subclasses">Subclasses<a class="headerlink" href="#subclasses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each class also has a number of subclasses presented in this book. Your subclass determines many of your hero's abilities and features, and further defines how you interact with the world from 1st level on. You choose a subclass when you create your character.</p>
<h3 id="abilities">Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Abilities are special actions, maneuvers, and more that allow you to affect creatures, objects, and the environment. They represent the main activities your character can undertake when the game is in combat or some other time-sensitive scenario. All characters have access to a few basic abilities, including free strikes and maneuvers such as Grab and Knockback (see Maneuvers in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>). But your class, ancestry (see <a href="#page-35-1">Chapter 3</a>), kit (<a href="#page-231-1">Chapter 6</a>), titles and treasures (<a href="#page-327-1">Chapter 13: Rewards</a>), and other heroic options give you access to more powerful abilities that make your hero stand out.</p>
<p>Abilities are presented in a special format that first describes the ability, then summarizes its mechanical details, and finally breaks out the ability's power roll (if it has one) and effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abilities in Combat</strong></p>
<p>All the abilities appearing in this book are used as a main action, a maneuver, a triggered action, or some other part of your turn. As such, these abilities are all explicitly usable in combat or some other time-sensitive scenario where the game unfolds as combat rounds. If a creature has an ability that takes 1 minute or longer to use, that ability can't be used in combat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="name-and-story-text">Name and Story Text<a class="headerlink" href="#name-and-story-text" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each ability has an evocative name that sets up what it does in the game, followed by a line or two of flavor text that provides a sense of how the use of the ability might appear if described in an action scene in a story.</p>
<p>The name and story text for abilities sometimes refers to specific ways in which the ability plays out—particularly combat abilities whose names imply specific types of weapons or tactics. However, that narrative flavor has no effect on how an ability can be used. For example, the fury's Impaled ability allows you to grab a target, setting up the idea of harpooning your monstrous foe with a sword to keep them close. But you can use that ability with an axe, a mace, a hammer, or any other weapon.</p>
<h4 id="heroic-resource-cost">Heroic Resource Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#heroic-resource-cost" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each class has a Heroic Resource that your hero earns during combat, with some of your class's abilities—typically your most potent abilities—having a Heroic Resource cost to use them. When you use one of these abilities, you spend some of the Heroic Resource bestowed by your class, then activate the ability.</p>
<p>The nine Heroic Resources in the game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The censor's wrath</li>
<li>The conduit's piety</li>
<li>The elementalist's essence</li>
<li>The fury's ferocity</li>
<li>The null's discipline</li>
<li>The shadow's insight</li>
<li>The tactician's focus</li>
<li>The talent's clarity</li>
<li>The troubadour's drama</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="heroic-abilities">Heroic Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#heroic-abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability has a Heroic Resource cost to activate—as in, you can't use the ability at all without spending some of your Heroic Resource—then it is a heroic ability. If an effect allows you to use heroic ability when it isn't your turn, you must sill pay its Heroic Resource cost to use it it unless the effect says otherwise.</p>
<p>Some abilities don't cost your Heroic Resource to use but allow you to spend your Heroic Resource to enhance or add effects to the ability, such as the conduit's Healing Grace. These abilities are not heroic abilities unless the baseline ability can't be used without spending your Heroic Resource.</p>
<h5 id="signature-abilities">Signature Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#signature-abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Some abilities granted by your class, kit, and other parts of the game are signature abilities. The rules specifically state when an ability is a signature ability. Signature abilities don't require your Heroic Resource to use, but sometimes let you spend your Heroic Resource to enhance or add to their effects.</p>
<h4 id="ability-keywords">Ability Keywords<a class="headerlink" href="#ability-keywords" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each ability has one or more keywords that explain how the ability functions. Keywords appear in the first line of the ability beneath the flavor text, on the left side, and can include any of the following entries. (An ability that has no keywords is noted as "—".)</p>
<h5 id="area">Area<a class="headerlink" href="#area" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Area keyword create an area of effect. Many area abilities deal damage to targets in their area, but such abilities are treated differently than strikes made against specific targets. (See the <a href="#page-84-4">It's Not All Strikes!</a> sidebar, as well as <a href="#page-84-3">Strike</a> and <a href="#page-85-1">Area Abilities</a> below for more information.)</p>
<h5 id="charge">Charge<a class="headerlink" href="#charge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Charge keyword can be used with the Charge main action instead of a melee free strike. (The Charge main action is described in Main <a href="#page-288-0">Actions</a> in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="magic">Magic<a class="headerlink" href="#magic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Magic keyword are used by characters who can cast spells, have innate magical features, or wield magic treasures. Such abilities do magical things such as create rays of fire, open swirling portals, or summon creatures.</p>
<h5 id="melee">Melee<a class="headerlink" href="#melee" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Melee keyword can be used only over very short distances, typically within a character's reach, because they require a character to make contact with a creature or object with their body, a weapon, or an implement. (An implement is a special object used by characters channeling magic or psionic power, described in <a href="#page-310-0">Imbue Treasure</a> in <a href="#page-307-2">Chapter 12: Downtime Projects</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="psionic">Psionic<a class="headerlink" href="#psionic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Psionic keyword are used by characters who can manifest psionic powers, have innate psionic features, or wield psionic items. These abilities might create blasts of psychic energy, move objects with telekinesis, or slow down time with chronopathy.</p>
<h5 id="ranged">Ranged<a class="headerlink" href="#ranged" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Ranged keyword can be used to affect creatures who are too far away to make contact with.</p>
<h5 id="strike">Strike<a class="headerlink" href="#strike" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Abilities with the Strike keyword (often referred to simply as "strikes") deal damage to or impose a harmful effect on specific creatures or objects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It's Not All Strikes!</strong></p>
<p>The Strike keyword and phrases such as "makes a strike" are reserved for abilities that have a creature targeting specific creatures or objects (not affecting creatures or objects in an area) and harming those targets in some way by making a power roll. The many abilities in the game that target areas of effect are not strikes. They instead use the Area keyword. That means if a feature distinctly interacts with a strike, that feature has no effect on abilities with the Area keyword.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="weapon">Weapon<a class="headerlink" href="#weapon" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The Weapon keyword is used in abilities that must be used with a blade, a bow, or some other offensive weapon. Weapon abilities also include strikes creatures make with their own bodies, such as a character's unarmed strikes or a monster's punches, kicks, bites, tail slaps, and more.</p>
<p>Your character's kit determines the types of weapons you wield and use with your weapon abilities (see <a href="#page-231-0">Chapter 6: Kits</a>).</p>
<h4 id="type">Type<a class="headerlink" href="#type" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each ability notes the type of activity required to use it, on the right side of the first line beneath the flavor text. Most abilities require you to use a main action, a maneuver, a move action, a triggered action, a free maneuver, or a free triggered action (with all those terms explained in <a href="#page-281-5">Taking a Turn</a> in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>). For instance, if you use an ability that has "Main Action" as its type entry, you must use your main action to activate the ability.</p>
<h5 id="trigger">Trigger<a class="headerlink" href="#trigger" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability requires a triggered action or a free triggered action to use, a "Trigger" entry is part of the ability. For example, the trigger for the tactician's Parry ability is: "A creature deals damage to the target." A tactician can use their Parry ability only when that specific triggering event occurs.</p>
<h4 id="distance">Distance<a class="headerlink" href="#distance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An ability's "Distance" entry, represented by this symbol e, indicates how close you need to be to a creature or object to affect that target with the ability.</p>
<h5 id="melee_1">Melee<a class="headerlink" href="#melee_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Melee abilities have a distance of "Melee X" and require you to make contact with a creature with your body, a weapon, or an implement. The number X is the maximum distance in squares at which you can physically make contact with another creature or object targeted by the ability. For instance, a distance of "Melee 2" can be used to target creatures or objects within 2 squares of you, while "Melee 1" limits you to adjacent targets (those within 1 square).</p>
<h5 id="ranged_1">Ranged<a class="headerlink" href="#ranged_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Ranged abilities have a distance of "Ranged X" and can be used to target creatures or objects too far away for you to make contact with. The number X is the maximum distance in squares at which a creature or object can be targeted by the ability. For instance, a distance of "Ranged 5" can be used to target creatures or objects within 5 squares of you.</p>
<p>If you make a ranged strike while any enemy is adjacent to you (within 1 square), you have a bane on the strike's power roll. (See <a href="#page-19-6">Edges and Banes</a> in <a href="#page-17-3">Chapter 1: The Basics</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="melee-or-ranged">Melee or Ranged<a class="headerlink" href="#melee-or-ranged" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Some abilities have a melee distance and a ranged distance. When you use such an ability, you choose whether to use it as a melee or a ranged ability.</p>
<p>An ability never has both the Melee and Ranged keywords at the same time. For example, if you have the Cloak and Dagger kit, which has a weapon damage bonus to melee abilities and a weapon damage bonus to ranged abilities, only one bonus at a time applies to an ability with both the Melee and Ranged keywords. (See <a href="#page-231-0">Chapter 6: Kits</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="self">Self<a class="headerlink" href="#self" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability has a distance of "Self," that ability originates from you, and often affects only you. The ability's description specifies how it works.</p>
<h4 id="area-abilities">Area Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#area-abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Area abilities cover a number of squares on the battlefield at once, creating an effect within that area that lets you target multiple creatures or objects. When an ability creates an area of effect, it sometimes notes a distance for the effect in the form "within X." The number X tells you how many squares away from you the area can be. If an area ability doesn't have this distance, it originates from you and you are at the center of the area.</p>
<p>If an area ability originates a distance away from you, then one square of the area of effect must be within that distance, and must also be within your line of effect (see below). This square is referred to as the <strong>origin square</strong> of the area of effect. The area of effect can spread from the origin square however you choose, according to the rules for the shape and arrangement of that particular area.</p>
<p>You can place an area of effect to include one or more squares where you don't have line of effect, as long as you have line of effect to the origin square. Unless otherwise noted, area abilities don't pass through solid barriers such as walls or ceilings, and they don't spread around corners.</p>
<p>An area ability might use any of the following areas of effect.</p>
<h5 id="aura">Aura<a class="headerlink" href="#aura" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When an ability creates an aura, that area is expressed as "X aura." The number X is the radius of the aura, which always originates from you and moves with you for the duration of the ability that created it. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted by an aura ability.</p>
<h5 id="burst">Burst<a class="headerlink" href="#burst" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When an ability creates a burst area, that area is expressed as "X burst." The number X is the radius of the burst, which always originates from you and lasts only for as long as it takes to affect its targets. A creature or object must be within X squares of you to be targeted by a burst ability.</p>
<h5 id="cube">Cube<a class="headerlink" href="#cube" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When an ability affects a cubic area, that area is expressed as "X cube." The number X is the length of each of the area's sides. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a cube ability.</p>
<h5 id="line">Line<a class="headerlink" href="#line" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When an ability affects a linear area, that area is expressed as "A × B line." The number A denotes the line's length in squares, while the number B equals the line's width and height in squares. When you create a line area of effect, the squares in that area must be in a straight line. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a line ability.</p>
<h5 id="wall">Wall<a class="headerlink" href="#wall" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When an ability creates a wall, that area is expressed as "X wall." The number X is how many squares are used to make the wall. When you place a wall, you can build it one square at a time, but each square must share at least one side (not just a corner) with another square of the wall. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a wall ability.</p>
<p>the wall. A creature or object must be within the area to be targeted by a wall ability.</p>
<p>You can stack squares on top of each other to make the wall higher. Unless otherwise stated, a wall can't be placed in occupied squares, and a wall blocks line of effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Straight Lines</strong></p>
<p>Talking about a straight line area of effect on an encounter map doesn't mean the line can only be a straight vertical or horizontal line of contiguous squares. It means each square in the line's length must move in the same direction without bending back in an opposite direction. To make a line area quickly, pick your line's origin square, then pick each subsquent square in the line one at a time in a single direction without bending back in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>Likewise, abilities and effects that require a creature to move in a straight line, such as the Charge main action or forced movement that is a push or a pull, don't have to take the form of a straight series of squares on the grid. Simply move the creature one square at a time in a single direction without ever bending back in a direction opposite to where they've already moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="target"><strong>Target</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#target" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The "Target" entry of an ability, represented by this symbol x, notes the number of creatures, objects, or both who can be targeted by that ability. You can always affect fewer targets than the number indicated by this entry.</p>
<h5 id="creature">Creature<a class="headerlink" href="#creature" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability targets one or more creatures, it can affect creatures within the ability's distance or area. You aren't an eligible creature target for your own abilities unless those abilities also have "self" as a target (see below), or unless the ability indicates otherwise.</p>
<h5 id="object">Object<a class="headerlink" href="#object" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability targets one or more objects, it can affect any object within the ability's distance or area. Unless otherwise noted, objects have poison immunity all and psychic immunity all. <a href="#page-291-1">(Damage</a> in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a> has information on damage immunity.)</p>
<p>When an ability can target creatures and objects, the ability can damage objects. However, unless otherwise noted (as with the talent's Minor Telekinesis ability) or if the Director allows it, objects are immune to an ability's other effects. If an ability forces an object to make a test, the object automatically gets a tier 1 result on the test.</p>
<h5 id="enemy">Enemy<a class="headerlink" href="#enemy" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability targets one or more enemies, it can affect only creatures who are hostile to the creature using the ability. Typically, you decide who counts as an enemy for the purpose of using your hero's abilities, though the Director has the final say.</p>
<h5 id="ally">Ally<a class="headerlink" href="#ally" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability targets one or more allies, it can affect only willing creatures who are friendly to the creature using the ability. Typically, you and any other player whose character you target with an ability decide who counts as an ally, though the Director has the final say.</p>
<p>You aren't an eligible target for your own abilities that target allies unless those abilities also have "self" as a target, or unless the ability indicates otherwise.</p>
<h5 id="self_1">Self<a class="headerlink" href="#self_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability targets "self," it can affect only the creature using the ability. Your own abilities can affect you only if they target "self."</p>
<h5 id="each-target">Each [Target]<a class="headerlink" href="#each-target" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an area ability doesn't provide a number of targets but instead says it applies to each creature, object, enemy, or ally in the area, then all eligible targets for the ability are affected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Telling Friend From Foe</strong></p>
<p>There might be times when a foe disguises or obscures themself so that they're temporarily seen as an ally—or at least not seen as an enemy. Until the effect ends, such a creature can't be targeted by abilities that would usually target them by targeting enemies. Fear not, though. All classes have access to at least one ability that targets creatures, whether friend or foe.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="ability-roll">Ability Roll<a class="headerlink" href="#ability-roll" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If an ability requires a power roll, it has a "Power Roll" entry that tells you which characteristic to add to the 2d10 roll you make when you use the ability. (<a href="#page-17-3">Chapter 1: The Basics</a> talks about power rolls.)</p>
<p>Unlike power rolls made as tests (see Chapter 9), ability rolls always do something useful. You're rolling to determine the impact of the ability, including how much damage it deals and any other effects it imposes based on the tier outcome of the power roll. For instance, the fury's Brutal Slam ability is a melee strike that targets one adjacent creature (within 1 square), and which has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tier 1 (11 or lower):</strong> The ability deals damage equal to 3 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 1 square.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2 (12</strong>*–*<strong>16):</strong> The ability deals damage equal to 6 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 2 squares.</li>
<li><strong>Tier 3 (17 or higher):</strong> The ability deals damage equal to 9 + your Might score, then pushes the target back 4 squares.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="characteristics-and-damage">Characteristics and Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristics-and-damage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h6>
<p>Certain damage-dealing abilities note that damage as a number followed by a plus sign (+) and the letter M , A , R , I , or P . The indicated letter means you add your characteristic score—either Might, Agility, Reason, Intuition, or Presence—to the damage dealt by the ability. Certain abilities let you use your highest characteristic score for the power roll.</p>
<p>Using the fury's Brutal Slam ability as an example again, that ability uses a Might power roll and features the following damage expressions in the three tier outcomes of the power roll:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> 3 + M damage</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> 6 + M damage</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> 9 + M damage</li>
</ul>
<p>For a fury with a Might of 2, the ability's damage breakdown would be:</p>

<li><strong>≤11:</strong> 5</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> 11</li>
</ul>
<p>The damage for these abilities increases at each echelon of play, since your characteristics improve each time you reach a new echelon.</p>
<p>Some abilities, including your free strikes, allow you to pick which characteristic score you add to their damage. Such abilities use a format similar to "7 + M or A damage," indicating that you can add your Might or your Agility to determine the damage.</p>
<p>(<a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a> has more information on damage.)</p>
<h5 id="abilities-with-damage-and-effects">Abilities With Damage and Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#abilities-with-damage-and-effects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Strikes and area abilities can deal damage and have an additional effect on a target. The damage and the strength of the effect are determined by the ability roll.</p>
<p>To keep things moving quickly and to make abilities easy to read during play, damage and effects are separated with a semicolon in a power roll tier entry, with effects abbreviated whenever possible. An effect determined by a power roll always applies to the target unless otherwise specified. For example, the Brutal Slam ability mentioned above has the following power roll setup in the ability format:</p>
<p><strong>Power Roll +</strong> Might**:**</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> 3 + M damage; push 1</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> 6 + M damage; push 2</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> 9 + M damage; push 4</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, any effects that are determined by a power roll's tier outcome occur after the power roll's damage has been dealt to all targets. If an ability roll deals damage to multiple targets but its effect targets the creature using the ability or the Director, such as Muse of Fire, then the effect only occurs once, not once per target. If different tiered outcomes affect multiple targets, the creature using the ability picks which tier of rolled effect applies to them or the Director. If an ability creates multiple effects, those effects resolve in the order in which they are presented.</p>
<h4 id="during-the-move">"During the Move"<a class="headerlink" href="#during-the-move" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certain ability effects allow you to move and affect other creatures or objects during that move, such as the shadow's One Hundred Throats ability. For such abilities, the move begins in the space you first leave when you start the move and ends in the last space you move into.</p>
<h4 id="rolled-damage">Rolled Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#rolled-damage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Certain effects talk about rolled damage, which refers to the variable damage determined by making an ability roll. If an ability or effect deals damage without requiring a power roll, that is not rolled damage, and effects that add to or are triggered by rolled damage don't apply.</p>
<h4 id="potencies">Potencies<a class="headerlink" href="#potencies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Many abilities and other effects impose conditions and unique statuses on targets. But creatures sometimes get a chance to resist such effects. After all, a monster with a high Might should be harder to knock prone most of the time than a creature lacking in that characteristic.</p>
<p>Ability effects that have a <strong>potency</strong> are applied to a target only if the effect's potency value is higher than the target's indicated characteristic score. The characteristic a target uses to resist a potency is based on the ability used, while the value of the potency for your hero's abilities is based on one of your characteristics and determined by your class.</p>
<p>Your character has a <strong>weak</strong>, an <strong>average</strong>, and a <strong>strong</strong> potency value, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your weak potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 2.</li>
<li>Your average potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score − 1.</li>
<li>Your strong potency value is equal to your highest characteristic score.</li>
</ul>
<p>In abilities and other effects, a potency always appears as the single-letter abbreviation for the target's characteristic: M for Might, A for Agility, R for Reason, I for Intuition, or P for Presence. That characteristic is followed by a "less than" sign (\&lt;) and your potency value—for example, M\&lt;w or R\&lt;v —with the value indicating the minimum score in that characteristic that the target needs to beat the effect.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the conduit's Judgment's Hammer ability, which has the following power roll:</p>
<p><strong>Power Roll + Intuition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> 3 + I holy damage; A &lt; WEAK, prone</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> 6 + I holy damage; A &lt; AVERAGE, prone</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> 9 + I holy damage; A &lt; STRONG, prone and can't stand (save ends)</li>
</ul>
<p>At 1st level, a conduit uses their Intuition score to determine their potency values, and that score is 2. That gives the conduit the following potencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak: 0</li>
<li>Average: 1</li>
<li>Strong: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>When writing Judgment's Hammer on their character sheet, the conduit's player updates the damage and converts the weak, average, and strong potencies into their numerical values, knowing that those values won't change until the character hits 2nd echelon and their Intuition score becomes 3. That produces the following:</p>
<p><strong>Power Roll + Intuition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> 5 holy damage; A &lt; 0, prone</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> 8 holy damage; A &lt; 1, prone</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> 11 holy damage; A &lt; 2, prone and can't stand (save ends)</li>
</ul>
<p>During a game session, the conduit uses Judgment's Hammer to target a bandit with an Agility score of 0. The ability thus has the following outcomes at each tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a tier 1 outcome (11 or lower), the ability deals 5 holy damage to the bandit. But the bandit resists the additional effect because they have Agility 0 (and therefore don't have an Agility of less than 0).</li>
<li>With a tier 2 outcome (12–16), the ability deals 8 holy damage. But the bandit is also knocked prone, unable to resist the additional effect because they would need an Agility of 1 or higher to do so. If the bandit had Agility 1 or higher, they would have taken 8 holy damage but stayed standing.</li>
<li>With a tier 3 outcome (17 or higher), the bandit takes 11 holy damage and is knocked flat and left struggling to stand, unable to resist the strong potency of the additional effect with a mere Agility 0.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="potency-presentation">Potency Presentation<a class="headerlink" href="#potency-presentation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Potencies are presented in an abbreviated style in abilities so they don't take up too much space, and so you can read them by saying: "If the target's [characteristic] is less than [potency value], they [suffer effect]." If our 1st-level conduit obtained a tier 2 outcome when using Judgment's Hammer, the player would say, "I deal 8 holy damage, and if the bandit's Agility is less than 1, they fall prone."</p>
<p>Reading the ability this way prevents a lot of back and forth. You don't need to ask, "What's the target's Agility score?", wait for a response, and then give the outcome. You can simply say, "If they don't have an Agility of 1 or higher, they fall prone." Players can let the Director figure out whether the target is prone and keep the game moving, with the Director doing the same in reverse when monsters and other foes use abilities with potencies against the heroes.</p>
<h5 id="adjusting-potencies">Adjusting Potencies<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-potencies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Potencies are made for quick resolution at the table, but a number of triggered actions and other abilities—for example, the censor's Judgment ability and the null's Null Field ability—allow you to manipulate the value of potencies. If you build a hero who can adjust potencies, pay attention during combat! You might be able to help out a friend who needs a little boost to make their ability take full effect, or hinder an enemy about to lock down one of your allies.</p>
<h5 id="spending-resources-on-potencies">Spending Resources on Potencies<a class="headerlink" href="#spending-resources-on-potencies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability or feature allows you to spend your Heroic Resource on an effect that is entirely dependent on a potency and the target is unaffected because their characteristic is high enough to resist the potency, then you don't spend the Heroic Resource.</p>
<p>For example, the tactician's Overwatch ability allows the tactician to spend 1 focus to impose the slowed condition on a target who has R\&lt;v. Since spending focus this way has no other effect, if the tactician targets a creature whose high Reason leaves them unaffected, the tactician doesn't waste any focus. However, if spending this focus had another automatic effect such as dealing extra damage to the target, the 1 focus would be spent even though the potency was resisted.</p>
<p>This rule also applies to Director-controlled creatures who spend Malice on abilities and features that affect a target using a potency and have no other automatic effects.</p>
<h4 id="critical-hit">Critical Hit<a class="headerlink" href="#critical-hit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you make an ability roll as a main action and the roll is a natural 19 or natural 20—a total of 19 or 20 before adding your characteristic score or other modifiers—you score a critical hit. A critical hit allows you to immediately take an additional action after resolving the power roll, whether or not it's your turn and even if you are dazed (see <a href="#page-91-2">Conditions</a> below).</p>
<p>You can't score a critical hit with an ability roll made as a maneuver or any other action type, but you can score a critical hit with a main action you use off your turn. For example, an opportunity attack made as a triggered action or a signature ability used as a free triggered action with the assistance of the tactician's Strike Now ability can be critical hits.</p>
<h4 id="roll-against-multiple-creatures">Roll Against Multiple Creatures<a class="headerlink" href="#roll-against-multiple-creatures" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When an ability has multiple targets (whether a strike with more than one target or an area affect), you make one power roll and apply the total to all targets. If you have edges or banes (see <a href="#page-17-3">Chapter 1: The Basics</a>) against some but not all of your targets, you might apply a different tier outcome to individual targets.</p>
<p>For example, if you target three creatures with a strike ability and the power roll totals 11, each of the targets should be affected by the tier 1 outcome of the ability. However, if you gain an edge on strikes against one of the targets to add 2 to the power roll, your total against that target is 13, and they are affected by the tier 2 outcome of the ability.</p>
<h4 id="surges">Surges<a class="headerlink" href="#surges" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A troubadour's battle song, a fury's building ferocity, and a shadow's patient insight can all make a hero more effective in a fight. These advantages are represented by surges, with many abilities granting heroes surges during a battle.</p>
<p>When you gain surges, you keep track of them on your character sheet. Surges can be used in combat to deal extra damage to your foes and increase the value of your potencies, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you deal rolled damage, you can spend up to 3 surges to deal extra damage to one creature or object targeted by the ability. Each surge you spend deals extra damage equal to your highest characteristic score.</li>
<li>Whenever you target one or more creatures with an ability that has a potency, you can spend 2 surges to increase the potency by 1 for one target. You can't increase a potency by more than 1 using surges, though you can spend additional surges to increase the potency for multiple targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>You lose surges as you spend them. At the end of combat, you lose any surges you have remaining.</p>
<h4 id="effect">Effect<a class="headerlink" href="#effect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Many abilities that require power rolls also have effect entries describing additional effects or rules for how the ability is used. If an ability doesn't require a power roll, it has an effect entry that describes how it works.</p>
<h5 id="actions-within-actions">Actions Within Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#actions-within-actions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an ability's effect allows you to take a main action, a maneuver, a move action, or a triggered action, the cost of doing so is subsumed in the ability's type entry on the first line below the flavor text. You never need to spend additional time to use an ability. For example, the shadow's Black Ash Teleport ability is a maneuver that allows you to teleport and then use the Hide maneuver as its overall effect. Using the Hide maneuver is part of the maneuver to use the ability, so that you don't need to have another maneuver available to do so.</p>
<h4 id="spend-heroic-resource">Spend Heroic Resource<a class="headerlink" href="#spend-heroic-resource" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some abilities have a "Spend X [Heroic Resource]" entry in the body of the ability. These grant additional effects to an ability, where X is the amount of your Heroic Resource you must spend to activate those effects. If an entry reads "Spend X+ [Heroic Resource]," you can spend as much of your available Heroic Resource as you like in multiples of X to increase the effect's impact, as described in the entry's details.</p>
<h4 id="stacking-unique-effects">Stacking Unique Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#stacking-unique-effects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The unique effects of different abilities are combined—effectively stacking on top of each other—if their durations and targets overlap. However, the effects of the same ability used multiple times don't stack. Instead, the most impactful effect—such as the highest bonus—from each use of the ability applies. The most recently used ability applies for determining duration.</p>
<p>For example, the null's Null Field ability reduces the potencies of enemies within the field by 1. If two allied nulls each have their Null Field ability active and an enemy cultist is targeted by both abilities, that cultist's potencies are reduced by 1, not by 2.</p>
<p>Different effects that impose the same condition (see <a href="#page-91-2">Conditions</a> below) don't stack to impose the condition twice. For instance, if a hero is targeted by numerous creatures whose abilities cause a target to become weakened (imposing a bane on the target's power rolls), the target isn't weakened twice to impose a double bane on those rolls. A character who is grabbed by an enemy can't be grabbed again by another enemy. The same holds true for game effects that aren't conditions. For example, if a hero is targeted by multiple abilities or effects that can halve their recovery value, the hero's recovery value is halved only once.</p>
<h4 id="ending-effects">Ending Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#ending-effects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When a creature suffers a lasting effect, whatever ability, feature, hazard, or other mechanic imposed the effect specifies how long the effect lasts. Unless otherwise noted, all effects and conditions that are imposed on heroes during a combat encounter end when the encounter is over if the hero wants them to, except for being winded, unconscious, or dying. After combat, effects and conditions imposed on other creatures end when it's convenient for the heroes, allowing characters to easily bind or slip away from unconscious foes. However, the Director is free to decide that an unconscious dragon doesn't stay that way long enough to be tied up.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-next-turn-eot">End of Next Turn (EoT)<a class="headerlink" href="#end-of-next-turn-eot" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Many effects last until the end of the target's next turn, abbreviated as "(EoT)" in the tier outcomes for an ability's power roll. A creature suffers from such an effect until the end of their next turn, or the end of their current turn if the effect was imposed on their current turn.</p>
<h5 id="saving-throw-save-ends">Saving Throw (Save Ends)<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-throw-save-ends" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>If an effect has "(save ends)" at the end of its description, a creature suffering the effect makes a saving throw at the end of each of their turns to remove the effect. A saving throw represents the sheer luck involved in shaking off an effect. Because a target typically had a chance to avoid a "save ends" effect using a characteristic score to resist a potency, it's now down to fate.</p>
<p>To make a saving throw, a creature rolls a d10. On a 6 or higher, the effect ends. Otherwise, it continues.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-encounter">End of Encounter<a class="headerlink" href="#end-of-encounter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Some effects last until the end of the encounter. If such an effect is used outside of combat, it lasts 5 minutes.</p>
<h5 id="creature-ends-an-ability-effect">Creature Ends an Ability Effect<a class="headerlink" href="#creature-ends-an-ability-effect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who imposes an effect on another creature using an ability can end that effect as a free maneuver unless the ability says otherwise.</p>
<h5 id="adjacent">Adjacent<a class="headerlink" href="#adjacent" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Many abilities and other options refer to creatures, objects, or spaces that are adjacent to a specified creature. Something is adjacent to a creature if it is within 1 square of that creature.</p>
<h4 id="line-of-effect">Line of Effect<a class="headerlink" href="#line-of-effect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>To target a creature or object with an ability or effect, including making a strike against them, you must have line of effect to that target. If any solid object, such as a wall or pillar, completely blocks the target from you, then you don't have line of effect.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether you have line of effect to a target, imagine drawing a straight line from any corner of the space you occupy on an encounter map to any corner of a space the target occupies. If one or more corners of your space connect to any corner of the target's space with no obstruction in between, you have line of effect to the target.</p>
<p>At the Director's discretion, flimsy or fragile obstructions such as a glass window or linen curtains don't block line of effect, and might be automatically broken or torn by strikes or other abilities used through them.</p>
<p>If you use an ability that creates an environmental effect, such as a portal, you must have line of effect to the space where you create the environmental effect. If you want to create an area of effect in a specific area, you must have line of effect to at least one of the squares in that area. See <a href="#page-85-1">Area Abilities</a> above.</p>
<h4 id="straight-line">Straight Line<a class="headerlink" href="#straight-line" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whenever a creature moves or is subjected to forced movement—a push, pull, or slide (see <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>)—that movement is typically in a straight line. Abilities that allow you to move or to force move another creature often talk about moving straight toward or away from a creature or an object. But even when movement must be in a straight line, it doesn't have to be a horizontal or vertical line on an encounter map. (See the <a href="#page-85-10">Straight Lines</a> sidebar earlier in this chapter.)</p>
<h4 id="ground-and-ceiling">Ground and Ceiling<a class="headerlink" href="#ground-and-ceiling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some abilities and other effects refer to a hero or their targets being "on the ground." Unless otherwise indicated, "ground" means any surface a creature could typically stand, sit, or lie upon, whether a castle's stone floor, the dirt of a road, the deck of a ship, or a metal platform suspended high in the air.</p>
<p><span id="page-91-0"></span>Likewise, if an effect refers to a "ceiling," that means any solid surface above a creature, whether a wooden tavern ceiling, the rocky roof of a cave, or an invisible wall of force.</p>
<h4 id="conditions">Conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#conditions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some abilities and other effects apply specific negative effects called conditions to a creature. The following conditions show up regularly in the game and can be tracked on your character sheet when they affect your hero.</p>
<h5 id="bleeding">Bleeding<a class="headerlink" href="#bleeding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>While a creature is bleeding, whenever they use a main action, use a triggered action, or make a test or ability roll using Might or Agility, they lose Stamina equal to 1d6 + their level after the main action, triggered action, or power roll is resolved. This Stamina loss can't be prevented in any way.</p>
<p>You take damage from this condition when you use a main action off your turn. For example, a signature ability used as a free triggered action with the assistance of the tactician's Strike Now ability triggers the damage from the bleeding condition.</p>
<h5 id="dazed">Dazed<a class="headerlink" href="#dazed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is dazed can do only one thing on their turn: use a main action, use a maneuver, or use a move action. A dazed creature also can't use triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers.</p>
<h5 id="frightened">Frightened<a class="headerlink" href="#frightened" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>When a creature is frightened, any ability roll they make against the source of their fear takes a bane. If that source is a creature, their ability rolls made against the frightened creature gain an edge. A frightened creature can't willingly move closer to the source of their fear if they know the location of that source. If a creature gains the frightened condition from one source while already frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.</p>
<h5 id="grabbed">Grabbed<a class="headerlink" href="#grabbed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is grabbed has speed 0, can't be force moved except by a creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed, can't use the Knockback maneuver (see <a href="#page-287-0">Maneuvers</a> in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>), and takes a bane on abilities that don't target the creature, object, or effect that has them grabbed. If a creature is grabbed by another creature and that creature moves, they bring the grabbed creature with them. If a creature's size is equal to or less than the size of a creature they have grabbed, their speed is halved while they have that creature grabbed.</p>
<p>A creature who has another creature grabbed can use a maneuver to move the grabbed creature into an unoccupied space adjacent to them.</p>
<p>A creature can release a creature they have grabbed at any time to end that condition (no action required). A grabbed creature can attempt to escape being grabbed using the Escape Grab maneuver (see <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>). If a grabbed creature teleports, or if either the grabbed creature or the creature grabbing them is force moved so that both creatures are no longer adjacent to each other, that creature is no longer grabbed.</p>
<p>A creature can grab only creatures of their size or smaller. If a creature's Might score is 2 or higher, they can grab any creature larger than them with a size equal to or less than their Might score.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, a creature can grab only one creature at a time.</p>
<h5 id="prone">Prone<a class="headerlink" href="#prone" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>While a creature is prone, they are flat on the ground, any strike they make takes a bane, and melee abilities used against them gain an edge. A prone creature must crawl to move along the ground, which costs 1 additional square of movement for every square crawled. A creature can't climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If they are climbing, flying, or jumping when knocked prone, they fall.</p>
<p>Unless the ability or effect that imposed the prone condition says otherwise, a prone creature can stand up using the Stand Up maneuver (see <a href="#page-287-0">Maneuvers</a> in <a href="#page-288-0">Chapter 10: Combat</a>). A creature adjacent to a willing prone creature can likewise use the Stand Up maneuver to make that creature stand up.</p>
<h5 id="restrained">Restrained<a class="headerlink" href="#restrained" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is restrained has speed 0, can't use the Stand Up maneuver, and can't be force moved. A restrained creature takes a bane on ability rolls and on Might and Agility tests, and abilities used against them gain an edge.</p>
<p>If a creature teleports while restrained, that condition ends.</p>
<h5 id="slowed">Slowed<a class="headerlink" href="#slowed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is slowed has speed 2 unless their speed is already lower, and they can't shift.</p>
<h5 id="taunted">Taunted<a class="headerlink" href="#taunted" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is taunted has a double bane on ability rolls for any ability that doesn't target the creature who taunted them, as long as they have line of effect to that creature. If a creature gains the taunted condition from one source while already taunted by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.</p>
<h5 id="weakened">Weakened<a class="headerlink" href="#weakened" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>A creature who is weakened takes a bane on power rolls.</p>
<h4 id="abilities-in-class-tables">Abilities in Class Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#abilities-in-class-tables" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Each class in this chapter includes a table that shows the progression as a hero gains new levels in that class. Each of those tables has an Abilities column and another column that shows abilities granted by the hero's subclass, tracking all the heroic abilities a hero of that class has at each level. Each ability is represented by a numeral noting the ability's Heroic Resource cost.</p>
<p>For example a 6th-level censor has "Signature, 3, 5, 7, 9" in their Abilities column, and "5, 9" in their Order Abilities column (representing the censor's subclass). This means a censor of that level has a signature ability and four heroic abilities costing 3, 5, 7, and 9 wrath respectively, plus an additional two subclass heroic abilities costing 5 and 9 wrath.</p>

<h4 id="wrath">Wrath<a class="headerlink" href="#wrath" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The power you serve grants you a Heroic Resource called wrath, fueling your abilities as you censor those your church deems to be heretics.</p>
<h5 id="wrath-in-combat">Wrath in Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#wrath-in-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain wrath equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 wrath.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature judged by you (see <a href="#page-94-0">Judgment</a> below) deals damage to you, you gain 1 wrath. The first time each combat round that you deal damage to a creature judged by you, you gain 1 wrath.</p>
<p>You lose any remaining wrath at the end of the encounter.</p>
<h5 id="wrath-outside-of-combat">Wrath Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#wrath-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Though you can't gain wrath outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost wrath without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs wrath, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited wrath on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of wrath equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the censor, but they might appear in future products.)</p>
<h4 id="judgment">Judgment<a class="headerlink" href="#judgment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You pick out the enemies most worthy of your wrath and place a divine judgment upon them, censoring them with the power of your god. You have the following ability.</p>
<p><strong><span class="steel-compendium-ability">Judgment</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you use this ability again, you willingly end this effect (no action required), or another censor judges the target.
Whenever a creature judged by you uses a main action and is within your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.
When a creature judged by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target.
Additionally, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free triggered actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an adjacent creature judged by you starts to shift, you make a melee free strike against them and their speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn, preventing them from shifting.</li>
<li>When a creature judged by you within 10 squares makes a power roll, you cause them to take a bane on the roll.</li>
<li>When a creature judged by you within 10 squares uses an ability with a potency that targets only one creature, the potency is reduced by 1 for that creature.</li>
<li>If you damage a creature judged by you with a melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.
    You can choose only one free triggered action option at a time, even if multiple options are triggered by the same effect.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="judgment-order-benefit">Judgment Order Benefit<a class="headerlink" href="#judgment-order-benefit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The first time on a turn that you use your Judgment ability to judge a creature, you gain the following benefit based on your order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exorcist:</strong> You can teleport up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged creature. You do not need line of effect to your destination.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle:</strong> You can deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to the judged creature.</li>
<li><strong>Paragon:</strong> You can vertical pull the judged creature up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.</li>

<p>Each time you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares. Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations. Choose one of the following types of weather, each of which grants a benefit to you and your allies:</p>
<p><strong>Clear:</strong> You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.</p>
<p><strong>Foggy:</strong> You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.</p>
<p><strong>Overcast:</strong> You and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.</p>
<p><strong>Precipitation:</strong> When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.</p>
<p>If you are in the same area as a creature using this or a similar feature who has chosen a different weather effect, the features negate each other where their areas overlap.</p>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal has speed 5 and can fly, but can't physically interact with the world. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you automatically sense everything that type of animal would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings.

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends.

<p>Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.</p>

<h5 id="it-was-foretold">It Was Foretold<a class="headerlink" href="#it-was-foretold" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your order has trained you to understand fragments of the visions granted to you by your deity, giving you a momentary advantage in challenging situations. At the start of an encounter, you can take one main action before any other creature and before your first turn. Additionally, whenever the Director calls for a montage test, you can make one free test before the montage begins, which counts as an earned success or failure as usual.</p>
<h5 id="judge-of-character">Judge of Character<a class="headerlink" href="#judge-of-character" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your focus on your fragmentary visions grants divine insight into the world and its creatures beyond your usual senses. Whenever you would make an Intuition test, you can make a Presence test instead.</p>
<h5 id="lead-by-example">Lead by Example<a class="headerlink" href="#lead-by-example" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your devotion to your deity allows you to take command of the battlefield, letting your allies benefit from your wisdom. While you are adjacent to a creature, your allies gain the benefits of flanking against that creature. Additionally, your allies gain an edge on tests made to aid other creatures with their tests.</p>
<h5 id="saints-vigilance">Saint's Vigilance<a class="headerlink" href="#saints-vigilance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You have honed your ability to detect sin and can use it to find those who hide from justice. Any creature judged by you can't use the Hide maneuver. Additionally, you gain an edge when searching for hidden creatures. If you find a hidden creature, you can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action.</p>
<h5 id="a-sense-for-truth">A Sense for Truth<a class="headerlink" href="#a-sense-for-truth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You are trained in secret techniques from your order that allow you to discern the truth with supernatural precision. If a creature is of a lower level than you, you automatically know when they are lying, though you don't necessarily know the actual truth behind their lie. Additionally, you gain an edge on tests made to detect lies or hidden motives.</p>
<h5 id="stalwart-icon">Stalwart Icon<a class="headerlink" href="#stalwart-icon" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You exhibit a small spark of your deity's power, causing creatures to trust or fear you, depending on what you need. You gain an edge on tests made to intimidate or persuade others.</p>
<h4 id="2nd-level-order-ability">2nd-Level Order Ability<a class="headerlink" href="#2nd-level-order-ability" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<p>You are the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the timescape. Whenever you use your Judgment ability, you can use a free triggered action to use a conduit domain effect (see <a href="#page-110-0">Domain Piety and Effects</a> in the <a href="#page-108-0">Conduit</a> section) associated with your chosen domain, or a domain you access with virtue (see below). If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your censor level instead.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must</p>
<p>answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.</p>
<p>While you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 id="virtue">Virtue<a class="headerlink" href="#virtue" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You have an epic resource called virtue. Each time you finish a respite, you gain virtue equal to the XP you gain. You can spend virtue on your abilities as if it were wrath.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend 3 virtue to access one of your deity's domains that you usually don't have access to. When you do, you can use that domain's features until you finish another respite.</p>
<p>Virtue remains until you spend it.</p>
<h4 id="wrath-of-the-gods">Wrath of the Gods<a class="headerlink" href="#wrath-of-the-gods" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<p>The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine power, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. Though the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.</p>
<p><strong>As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, filling your enemies with awe and making you more worldly and aware.</strong></p>

<p>Choose a god or saint who your character reveres from Chapter 14: Gods and Religion, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity and choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.</p>
<p>After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. The two domains you pick make up your subclass, and your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Adûn for deity, and Life and Protection as domains.)</p>
<h4 id="piety">Piety<a class="headerlink" href="#piety" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods—but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. Before you roll to gain piety at the start of your turn, you can pray (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.</li>
<li>If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.</li>
<li>If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>You lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter.</p>

<h5 id="piety-outside-of-combat">Piety Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#piety-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety equal to your Victories.</p>
<h5 id="domain-piety-and-effects">Domain Piety and Effects<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-piety-and-effects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your choice of domains provides you with two additional ways to earn piety during combat, as triggered by specific events. You might even have a single event trigger both your piety effects. For example, the Sun domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes fire or holy damage, while the War domain grants piety when a nearby creature takes damage of 10 + your level or higher. If you have both those domains and a nearby creature takes an appropriate amount of fire damage, you gain piety from both your domains.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, you can choose one of your domains and have that domain's prayer effect take effect immediately.</p>

<p>You can commune with a network of spirits. As a respite activity, you speak the name of a creature who died and isn't undead. If the creature's spirit is free and willing to speak with you, they appear and you can have a conversation with them. During this time, the creature responds to you as they would have in life.

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You conjure a size 4 dragon that appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The dragon has speed 6 and can fly, stability 4, 100 Stamina, immunity all to fire damage, and uses your characteristics. The dragon disappears at the end of the encounter, if their Stamina drops to 0, or if you are dying.
On subsequent turns, you can use a main action to command the dragon to breathe magic fire in a 3 cube within 1 square of them. Make the following power roll targeting each enemy in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Power Roll + Intuition:</strong></p>

<p>As a 10th-level conduit, you gain the following features.</p>
<h4 id="avatar">Avatar<a class="headerlink" href="#avatar" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You are now an avatar of your god! When you use your Prayer feature, you can be affected by up to three prayers at once, and you can change all those prayers and your ward as a respite activity. You can also use a maneuver to activate one of your domain effects (see Domain Piety and Effects) without needing to pray.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.</p>
<h4 id="characteristic-increase_5">Characteristic Increase<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristic-increase_5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your Intuition score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.</p>
<h4 id="divine-power">Divine Power<a class="headerlink" href="#divine-power" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You have an epic resource called divine power. Each time you finish a respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend divine power on your abilities as if it were piety.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any conduit abilities you don't have, as the gods answer your prayers with temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have that usually costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.</p>
<p>Divine power remains until you spend it.</p>
<h4 id="most-pious">Most Pious<a class="headerlink" href="#most-pious" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When you roll for piety at the start of your turn in combat and you pray, you gain 1 additional piety.</p>
<h4 id="perk_10">Perk<a class="headerlink" href="#perk_10" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.</p>

Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.**</p>
<p><strong>As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, debilitate enemies, ward yourself and allies, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your elemental specialization determines which of these talents you excel at.</strong></p>

<p>As a 1st-level elementalist, you gain the following features.</p>
<h4 id="elemental-specialization">Elemental Specialization<a class="headerlink" href="#elemental-specialization" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air</strong> is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.</li>
<li><strong>Earth</strong> is the element of permanence. Earth abilities bolster your body and grant the power to permanently create and shape physical terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong> is the element of destruction. Fire abilities devastate enemies and melt objects to slag.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.</li>
<li><strong>Rot</strong> is the element of decay. Rot abilities harm and debuff enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Void</strong> is the element of the mystery. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.</li>
<li><strong>Water</strong> is the element of change. Water abilities enhance your allies' power, and alter your enemies' power for the worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>You choose an elemental specialization from the following options: earth, fire, green, or void. Your elemental specialization is your subclass, and your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels, including one of the following benefits. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) (<em>Quick Build:</em> Fire.)</p>
<h5 id="earth-acolyte-of-earth">Earth: Acolyte of Earth<a class="headerlink" href="#earth-acolyte-of-earth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an ability that has the Earth and Magic keywords, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.</p>

<h5 id="void-acolyte-of-the-mystery">Void: Acolyte of the Mystery<a class="headerlink" href="#void-acolyte-of-the-mystery" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>

<h4 id="essence">Essence<a class="headerlink" href="#essence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or a creature within 10 squares takes damage that isn't untyped or holy damage, you gain 1 essence.</p>
<p>You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.</p>
<h5 id="essence-outside-of-combat">Essence Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#essence-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>

Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic below), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence equal to your Victories.</p>

<h4 id="persistent-magic">Persistent Magic<a class="headerlink" href="#persistent-magic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.</p>
<p>You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).</p>
<p>If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.</p>
<p>If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 times your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.</p>

<p>You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.</p>
<p>Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.</p>
<p>You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T animal who fits the rodent type. When you take on an animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls undamaged to the ground (your choice).

Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice adjacent to the other portal.

<p>At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal to emerge from when entering a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.</p>

<p>You warp gravity around your heavenly body and can pull even the sturdiest titans toward your core. At the end of each of your turns, you target one creature or object within distance of your Hurl Element ability and vertical pull that target up to 5 squares. If their stability reduces this forced movement, they are pulled a minimum of 2 squares. This forced movement ignores stability for your allies.</p>

You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.</p>
<p>You can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level).</p>

<p>As a 10th-level elementalist, you gain the following features.</p>
<h4 id="breath">Breath<a class="headerlink" href="#breath" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You have an epic resource called breath. Each time you finish a respite, you gain breath equal to the XP you gain. You can spend any number of breath to gain essence (no action required). When you do, 1 breath becomes 3 essence.</p>
<p>Breath remains until you convert it to essence.</p>
<h4 id="characteristic-increase_8">Characteristic Increase<a class="headerlink" href="#characteristic-increase_8" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Your Reason score increases to 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum of 5.</p>
<h4 id="essential-being">Essential Being<a class="headerlink" href="#essential-being" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>When you gain essence at the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 4 essence instead of 3.</p>
<h4 id="one">One<a class="headerlink" href="#one" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You become the embodiment of the element of your chosen specialization. Whenever you use magic, elemental motes flit around you and your skin changes to reflect your element, taking on an earthen or stony appearance for earth, appearing like flickering flame for fire, gaining a leaf pattern for green, and becoming a starry expanse for void. Additionally, you gain one of the following benefits, as shown on the One Specialization Features table.</p>

<p>You have damage immunity 5.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a respite activity, you can shape the mundane earth around you in a 1-mile radius. You can open sinkholes, form mountains, level mundane structures or whole settlements, create canyons, raise islands or sink them in the sea, and perform similar feats. You can't use this respite activity if another creature within 1 mile is already using it. Once you use this respite activity, you can't use it again for 10 days.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-fire">Master of Fire<a class="headerlink" href="#master-of-fire" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The damage bonus of your Acolyte of Fire feature increases to +5 and applies to all your magic abilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, your Return to Formlessness ability can be used on supernatural objects (but not on artifacts). When you melt a treasure (see Chapter 13: Rewards), you gain breath equal to its echelon.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-green">Master of Green<a class="headerlink" href="#master-of-green" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>The number of Recoveries you have increases by 2, and each time you finish a respite, you can grant each ally who finished the respite with you 2 additional Recoveries. Your allies' additional Recoveries disappear when they finish their next respite.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a respite activity, you can perform a ritual that causes a fruit tree to spring from the ground, grow, mature, and produce 1d6 of a treasure called Life Fruit. You can use a respite activity to cause an existing tree to produce another 1d6 Life Fruit, but it does not grow these magic consumables on its own.</p>
<p>As a maneuver, a creature can consume a Life Fruit or feed it to an adjacent willing ally. When a creature eats a Life Fruit, they restore all their Stamina, they can end all conditions or effects on themself, and they can stand up if prone. Additionally, if the creature desires, their aging pauses for 1d10 years. If the creature eats additional Life Fruit and chooses to pause their aging, the effects don't stack. Instead, the creature gains the benefit from the Life Fruit that pauses their aging for the longest time.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-void">Master of Void<a class="headerlink" href="#master-of-void" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Whenever you willingly move, you can teleport.</p>
<p>Additionally, your mind is connected to the mystery and helps you find the answers you seek. You no longer require project sources for research projects. Whenever you use a respite activity to make a project roll for a research project, you automatically complete the project.</p>
<h4 id="perk_15">Perk<a class="headerlink" href="#perk_15" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You gain one crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="skill_8">Skill<a class="headerlink" href="#skill_8" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You gain one skill of your choice.</p>
<h2 id="fury">Fury<a class="headerlink" href="#fury" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You do not temper the heat of battle within you. You unleash it! Your experience in the wild taught you the secrets of predators, and now, like the raptor, the panther, the wolf, you channel unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial Chaos is your ally. Let others use finesse to clean up the wreckage left in your wake.</p>
<p><strong>As a fury, you devastate foes with overwhelming might, hurl yourself and enemies around the battlefield, and grow stronger as your ferocity increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.</strong></p>

<h4 id="primordial-aspect">Primordial Aspect<a class="headerlink" href="#primordial-aspect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You are a product of customs older than warfare, older than civilization, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and that left an aspect of that chaos inside you. You choose a primordial aspect from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Berserker.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Berserker:</strong> You channel your ferocity into physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that shape the world. You have the Lift skill.</li>
<li><strong>Reaver:</strong> You channel your ferocity into instinct and cunning, challenging the order of civilization. You have the Hide skill.</li>
<li><strong>Stormwight:</strong> You channel your ferocity into primordial storms and can take on the form of an animal or an animal hybrid form. You have the Track skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your primordial aspect is your subclass, and your choice of aspect determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.</p>
<h4 id="ferocity">Ferocity<a class="headerlink" href="#ferocity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Within the heat of battle, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called ferocity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Where's My Maneuver?</strong></p>
<p>Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, you might find yourself asking, "Where's the special maneuver for the fury?" The answer is that the class doesn't need its own maneuver, because most of the time, the fantasy of the fury has them using the Grab or Knockback maneuvers in combat. They're really good at those maneuvers too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.</p>

<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain ferocity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 ferocity.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that you take damage, you gain 1 ferocity. The first time you become winded or are dying in an encounter, you gain 1d3 ferocity.</p>

Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs ferocity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited ferocity on its effect, such as To the Uttermost End, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of ferocity equal to your Victories.</p>
<h4 id="growing-ferocity">Growing Ferocity<a class="headerlink" href="#growing-ferocity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of ferocity you have (see 1st-Level Aspect Features for details). These benefits last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of ferocity you spend during your turn.</p>
<p>Some Growing Ferocity benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the various Growing Ferocity tables in this section.</p>

<p>Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.</p>
<p>You graduated from a shadow college chosen from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (<em>Quick Build:</em> College of Black Ash.)</p>
<ul>
<li>College of Black Ash: The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates are unmatched in mobility, using sorcery to teleport around the battlefield, manipulate shadows, and summon darkness. You have the Magic skill.</li>
<li>College of Caustic Alchemy: The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You have the Alchemy skill.</li>
<li>College of the Harlequin Mask: Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You have the Lie skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your shadow college is your subclass, and your choice of college determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.</p>

<h5 id="insight-in-combat">Insight in Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#insight-in-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that you deal damage incorporating 1 or more surges, you gain 1 insight.</p>
<p>Whenever you use a heroic ability that makes use of a power roll, that ability costs 1 fewer insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability gains an edge or has a double edge against only one target.</p>

<h5 id="insight-outside-of-combat">Insight Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#insight-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Although you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.</p>

<p><strong>Spend 1 Insight:</strong> Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that creature.

<p>Whenever you reduce an adjacent non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your I'm No Threat ability and then move up to your speed.</p>
<p>If the creature is the same size as you, you can disguise yourself as them using I'm No Threat without spending insight. If you do, while I'm No Threat is active, the creature's body is disguised to look like your body. The illusion ends on their body if another creature physically interacts with it. When the illusion would end for either you or the creature's body, it ends for both.</p>

<h4 id="tactical-doctrine">Tactical Doctrine<a class="headerlink" href="#tactical-doctrine" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insurgent:</strong> Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.</li>
<li><strong>Mastermind:</strong> You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.</li>
<li><strong>Vanguard:</strong> You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.</p>

<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that you or any ally damages a creature marked by you (see Mark below), you gain 1 focus. The first time in a combat round that any ally within 10 squares of you uses a heroic ability, you gain 1 focus.</p>
<p>You lose any remaining focus at the end of the encounter.</p>
<h5 id="focus-outside-of-combat">Focus Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#focus-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited focus on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the tactician, but they might appear in future products.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tactician Abilities Explained</strong></p>
<p>Many of the tactician's abilities grant allies extra movement, damage, and actions. But what's happening in the fiction to allow this? The tactician is an incredible strategist and inspiring leader who is quick to give commands and inspiration that causes their allies to act. The tactician can quickly read the battlefield, analyze enemies, and then bark orders and encouragement that pushes their allies to greatness. Many of the names of the tactician's abilities are the actual commands they give their friends!</p>

<p>You command any room you walk into. While you are present during a negotiation, each hero with you treats their Renown as 2 higher than usual. Additionally, each hero with you during a combat encounter has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation.</p>
<h5 id="covert-operations">Covert Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#covert-operations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests using any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist another creature with any test made using a skill from the intrigue group.</p>
<p>At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of a negotiation.</p>
<h5 id="studied-commander">Studied Commander<a class="headerlink" href="#studied-commander" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are present, each hero with you treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12: Downtime Projects for more information.)</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC in the negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.</li>

<h4 id="field-arsenal">Field Arsenal<a class="headerlink" href="#field-arsenal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You have drilled with a broad array of arms and armor, and have developed techniques to optimize their use. You can use and gain the benefits of two kits, including both their signature abilities. Whenever you would choose or change one kit, you can choose or change your second kit as well. See Chapter 6: Kits for more information. (<em>Quick Build:</em> Shining Armor, Sniper.)</p>
<p>If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.)</p>
<p>For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stamina Bonus: +12 per echelon</li>
<li>Stability Bonus: +1</li>
<li>Melee Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2</li>
<li>Ranged Damage Bonus: +0/+0/+4</li>
<li>Speed Bonus: +1</li>
<li>Ranged Distance Bonus: +10</li>
<li>Disengage Bonus: +1</li>
<li>You can use the Patient Shot and Protective Attack signature abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kit signature abilities have their kit's bonuses already applied, which might require you to adjust the bonuses of the signature abilities you gain from a kit. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to 3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit to deal 3/6/13 damage.</p>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, until you are dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your mark on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a creature, your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within distance.
You can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other tactician abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same time. The mastermind tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures with this ability starting at 5th level.
While a creature marked by you is within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect gain an edge on power rolls made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you, you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered action:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason score.</li>
<li>The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.</li>
<li>The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.</li>

<p>Psionic abilities are grouped into categories according to their effects, with each category comprising one of many talent traditions:</p>

<li><strong>Animapathy</strong> abilities allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.</li>

<li><strong>Metamorphosis</strong> abilities allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others to perform preternatural exploits.</li>
<li><strong>Pyrokinesis</strong> abilities allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.</li>

<h4 id="clarity-and-strain">Clarity and Strain<a class="headerlink" href="#clarity-and-strain" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The focus and precision of your thoughts grant you a Heroic Resource called clarity that empowers your psionic abilities.</p>
<h5 id="clarity-in-combat">Clarity in Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#clarity-in-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first time each combat round that a creature is force moved, you gain 1 clarity.</p>
<p>You can spend clarity you don't have, pushing that Heroic Resource into negative numbers to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each negative point of clarity.</p>
<p>Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.</p>
<p>You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you use any ability or effect that costs clarity within 1 minute of using another such ability, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effect from using the new ability.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity equal to your Victories.</p>

<h5 id="drama-in-combat">Drama in Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#drama-in-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.</p>
<p>Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during a combat encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn, you gain 2 drama.</li>
<li>The first time any hero is made winded during the encounter, you gain 2 drama.</li>
<li>Whenever a creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20, you gain 3 drama.</li>
<li>When you or another hero dies, you gain 10 drama.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are dead, you continue to gain drama during combat as long as your body is intact. If you have 30 drama during the encounter in which you died, you can come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action required). If you are still dead after the encounter in which you died, you can't gain drama during future encounters.</p>
<p>You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.</p>
<h5 id="drama-outside-of-combat">Drama Outside of Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#drama-outside-of-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.</p>
<p>When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Auteur Troubadour</strong></p>
<p>Abilities like Guest Star, Missed Cue, and Twist at the End allow the auteur to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by temporarily removing creatures from an encounter, bringing people back to life, or causing a new ally to appear. These abilities and features are no more powerful than any other, but they're narratively different from shooting rays of fire or swinging a sword.</p>
<p>This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in <em>Draw Steel</em>, the auteur knows that the combat encounter playing out at your table is really a story being told sometime later, probably in a tavern.</p>
<p>When the auteur uses these abilities, they are changing that story. They rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the telling. What <em>actually</em> happened is a matter of some debate. Even the people who were there don't agree on exactly what took place. How people <em>remember</em> it is what's important!</p>
<p>This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it's too weird for you or your table, you could always interpret those abilities as a kind of magic. A school of conjuring that really does change the battlefield, which the auteur merely <em>flavors</em> as rewriting the story.</p>

<h4 id="scene-partner">Scene Partner<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-partner" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you obtain a success on a test to interact with an NPC using a skill from the interpersonal group, you can form a bond with that NPC. When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a maximum of 5).</p>
<p>You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of your active bonds to lose.</p>
<h4 id="routines">Routines<a class="headerlink" href="#routines" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You enter every battle with a set of performance abilities at the ready. Performances are magical presentations (such as songs, dances, poems, or gymnastic feats) that your allies can participate in. These abilities have the Performance keyword. At the start of each combat round, as long as you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either choose a new performance or maintain your current performance (no action required). Your performance lasts until you are unable to maintain it or until the end of the encounter.</p>
<p>You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick performance abilities. Your choice of class act grants you additional performances.</p>

<h4 id="appeal-to-the-muses">Appeal to the Muses<a class="headerlink" href="#appeal-to-the-muses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows' spirits, appealing to the muses to heighten a battle's drama. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain to achieve the same end.</p>
<p>Before you roll to gain drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director gains 1d3 Malice (see <em><a href="https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters">Draw Steel: Monsters</a></em>).</li>
<li>If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource, which you can keep or give to an ally within the distance of your active performance. The Director gains 1 Malice.</li>
<li>If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 of a Heroic Resource, which you can distribute among yourself and any allies within the distance of your active performance.</li>

<h5 id="allow-me-to-introduce-tonights-players">Allow Me to Introduce Tonight's Players<a class="headerlink" href="#allow-me-to-introduce-tonights-players" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use a main action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each ally can shift up to their speed, and ability rolls made against them have a double bane until the end of the combat round. Additionally, any surprised enemy is no longer surprised.</p>
<h5 id="formal-introductions">Formal Introductions<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-introductions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival (such as a calling card or a formal letter) addressed to an enemy. You can deliver the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area, send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can have only one notice active at a time.</p>
<p>The Director determines when the target receives your notice. When the target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per combat round during encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such encounter with 2 additional hero tokens (Chapter 1: The Basics). These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.</p>
<h5 id="my-reputation-precedes-me">My Reputation Precedes Me<a class="headerlink" href="#my-reputation-precedes-me" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
<p>You can invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with one or more NPCs who haven't met you before, automatically creating a bond with one of those NPCs from that group as if using your Scene Partner feature (above). This bond counts against the limit on active bonds from your Scene Partner feature. While the bond is active, all heroes present treat their Renown as 2 higher than usual for the purpose of entering into a negotiation with the bonded NPC.</p>
<p>The Director can award the heroes 1 hero token to make you infamous among the group of creatures instead, and preventing you from forming this bond. Until you take action to improve your reputation, all heroes present take a bane on tests made to interact with creatures in the group using skills from the interpersonal skill group. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the group.</p>
<h4 id="perk_41">Perk<a class="headerlink" href="#perk_41" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

At the end of the encounter, or when the guest star is reduced to 0 Stamina, they retreat or revert to a bystander.

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target gains 3 of their Heroic Resource, has a double edge on a power roll of their choice made during their next turn, is no longer slowed or weakened if they were before, and can immediately take their turn after yours if they have not taken their turn already this round.</p>

<p><em>If you can land the strike, the crowd goes wild.</em></p>

<p><strong>Effect:</strong> Add your current Stamina to your target's current Stamina, then you have half that total Stamina and the target has the remainder. If either of you would gain more Stamina this way than their Stamina maximum, the difference in Stamina between what that creature would gain and their maximum is gained by the other creature. Neither of you can gain more Stamina than your maximum this way. You then make a power roll.</p>
<p><strong>Power Roll + Presence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>≤11:</strong> You and the target can each end one effect on yourselves that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turns.</li>
<li><strong>12-16:</strong> You and the target can end any effects on yourselves that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of your turns.</li>
<li><strong>17+:</strong> You can choose any of the current effects on you and the target that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of your turns, apply the chosen effects to the target, and end the rest.</li>

<h4 id="applause">Applause<a class="headerlink" href="#applause" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You have an epic resource called applause. Each time you finish a respite, you gain applause equal to the XP you gain. You can spend applause on your abilities as if it were drama.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you or a creature within 3 squares would obtain a failure or a tier 1 outcome on a test, you can spend 1 applause to improve the outcome by 1 tier.</p>
<p>Applause remains until you spend it.</p>

<h4 id="greatest-of-all-time">Greatest of All Time<a class="headerlink" href="#greatest-of-all-time" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you obtain a success on a test, each NPC within your line of effect has their Impression score decreased by 4 during a negotiation (to a minimum of 1), and each ally within 3 squares of you gains an edge on their next test. These effects last until you start your next respite.</p>
<h4 id="perk_45">Perk<a class="headerlink" href="#perk_45" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
