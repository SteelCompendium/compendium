This site includes Draw Steel rules and documents currently sourced from the Backer Packet.

While I would love for the links to these pages to be static/permanent, the nature of the game being actively developed and tested means that these pages are subject to change without notice. As we get closer to release, the links should be less vulnerable to change, but we aren't quite there yet. I apologize for the inconvenience.

This site is backed by a markdown conversion of the Packet and can be found in the following repos. Please don't scrape the site; instead just download the source documents which will get updates as needed.
