### Still a Work in Progress

While I would love for the links to these pages to be static/permanent, these pages are subject to change without as I
organize data.  As things stabilize, the links should be less vulnerable to change, but we aren't quite there yet. I 
apologize for the inconvenience.

### Data Formats

Don't bother scraping the site!  I have already parsed the data, serialized it to json, yaml, and markdown, and have it 
available in Github.

##### Unified (Everything)

These repos contain data aggregated from all the other repos (Adventures, Bestiary, and Rules)

- [data-md](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-md): Markdown
- [data-md-dse](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-md-dse): Markdown for Draw Steel Elements Obsidian Plugin

##### Rules

These repos contain rules (Heroes book) data.

- [data-rules-md](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-rules-md): Markdown
- [data-rules-md-dse](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-rules-md-dse): Markdown for Draw Steel Elements Obsidian Plugin
- [data-rules-yaml](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-rules-yaml): Yaml
- [data-rules-json](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-rules-json): Json
- [data-rules-xml](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-rules-xml): Xml

##### Bestiary

- [data-bestiary-md](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-bestiary-md): Markdown

- [data-bestiary-json](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-bestiary-json): Json

This site is backed by a markdown conversion of the PDFs and can be found here: 
[github.com - SteelCompendium/data-md](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-md). Please don't scrape the site; 
instead the data in markdown, json, and yaml formats are available in github.  See the 
[list of Steel Compendium data repositories](https://steelcompendium.io/#draw-steel-data) for available formats.
