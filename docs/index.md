This site includes Draw Steel rules and documents currently sourced from the PDF releases.

While I would love for the links to these pages to be static/permanent, these pages are subject to change without as I
organize data.  As things stabilize, the links should be less vulnerable to change, but we aren't quite there yet. I 
apologize for the inconvenience.

This site is backed by a markdown conversion of the PDFs and can be found here: 
[github.com - SteelCompendium/data-md](https://github.com/SteelCompendium/data-md). Please don't scrape the site; 
instead the data in markdown, json, and yaml formats are available in github.  See the 
[list of Steel Compendium data repositories](https://steelcompendium.io/#draw-steel-data) for available formats.
